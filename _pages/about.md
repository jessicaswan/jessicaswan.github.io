I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Climate Systems Engineering iniatitve (CSEi) at The University of Chicago. 

<b>My research combines different modeling tools ranging from Earth System Models to AI emulators with the primary goal of understanding how climate geoengineering proposals might reduce regional climate change impacts.</b> While my formal training is in climate science, I have worked and collaborated on interdisciplinary topics including climate-driven human migration, integrating physical and social science datasets, and the economic and marine ecosystem impacts of marine cloud brightening. 

Prior to joining UChicago, I received my PhD in Earth Sciences and MS in Oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of California San Diego advised by [Dr. Kate Ricke](https://katericke.com/#research). While completing my PhD, I was a [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG)](https://ndseg.org/2022-class-fellows) fellow and an [Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS)](https://san-diego.arcsfoundation.org/scholars/2023-2024-arcs-scholars) scholar. Prior to graduate school, I received a BS in Environment & Sustainability with Distinction in Research from Cornell University. 

Outside of research, I enjoy playing and coaching ultimate frisbee, cooking, painting, and anything active in the great outdoors.

I am a climate science PhD candidate in [Dr. Kate Ricke's](https://katericke.com/#research) lab at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of California San Diego. 

My primary research seeks to understand how climate geoengineering proposals might alleviate regional climate change impacts. Specifically, I study a type of geoengineering called marine cloud brightening, which cools the planet by adding sea salt particles to the lower atmosphere to form brighter marine clouds. I use Earth system models to simulate how different scenarios of marine cloud brightening could be leveraged for climate risk mitigation.

I am a [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellow](https://ndseg.org/2022-class-fellows) and an [Achievement Rewards for College Scientsts (ARCS) scholar](https://san-diego.arcsfoundation.org/scholars/2023-2024-arcs-scholars). Prior to coming to SIO, I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Science in Environment & Sustainability with Distinction in Research. Outside of research, I enjoy playing and coaching ultimate frisbee, cooking, painting, and anything active in the great outdoors.

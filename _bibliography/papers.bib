This iron processing module was developed for use within Earth system models and has been updated within a modal aerosol framework from the original implementation in a bulk aerosol model. {MIMI} simulates the emission and atmospheric processing of two main sources of iron in aerosol prior to deposition: mineral dust and combustion processes. Atmospheric dissolution of insoluble to soluble iron is parametrized by an acidic interstitial reaction and a separate in-cloud reaction scheme based on observations of enhanced aerosol iron solubility in the presence of oxalate. Updates include a more comprehensive treatment of combustion iron emissions, improvements to the iron dissolution scheme, and an improved physical dust mobilization scheme. An extensive dataset consisting predominantly of cruise-based observations was compiled to compare to the model. The annual mean modelled concentration of surface-level total iron compared well with observations, but less so in the soluble fraction where observations are much more variable in space and time. Comparing model and observational data is sensitive to the definition of the average and the temporal and spatial range over which it is calculated. Through statistical analysis and examples, we show that a median or log-normal distribution is preferred when comparing with soluble iron observations. We redefined ocean deposition regions based on dominant iron emission sources and found that the daily variability in soluble iron simulated by {MIMI} was larger than that of previous model simulations. {MIMI} simulated a general increase in soluble iron deposition to Southern Hemisphere oceans by a factor of two to four compared with the previous version, which has implications for our understanding of the ocean biogeochemistry of these predominantly iron limited ocean regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

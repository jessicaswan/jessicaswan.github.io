  abstract={Marine cloud brightening is a solar geoengineering1–3 proposal to cool atmospheric temperatures and reduce some impacts of climate change. To-date, modeling studies of solar geoengineering have primarily focused on large-scale schemes with objectives of stabilizing or mediating changes in global mean temperature4–7. However, these global proposals pose substantial governance challenges8–10, making regional interventions tailored toward targeted climate outcomes potentially more attractive in the near-term. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of regional marine cloud brightening in the North Pacific designed to mitigate extreme heat in the Western United States. We find cloud brightening in a remote mid-latitude region cools our target region more than brightening in a proximate subtropical region, but both schemes reduce the relative risk of dangerous summer heat exposure under present-day conditions, by 39\% and 25\% respectively. However, the same cloud brightening interventions under mid-century warming produce significantly hotter rather than cooler summers, both in the Western U.S. and other areas of the world. We trace this loss of efficacy to a nonlinear response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to the combination of greenhouse gas driven warming and regional cloud brightening. Our result demonstrates a risk in assuming that regional interventions that are effective under certain conditions will remain effective as the climate continues to change.},

  title={Improved methodologies for Earth system modelling of atmospheric soluble iron and observation comparisons using the Mechanism of Intermediate complexity for Modelling Iron ({MIMI} v.1.0)},

  abstract={Herein, we present a description of the Mechanism of Intermediate complexity for Modelling Iron ({MIMI} v1.0). This iron processing module was developed for use within Earth system models and has been updated within a modal aerosol framework from the original implementation in a bulk aerosol model. {MIMI} simulates the emission and atmospheric processing of two main sources of iron in aerosol prior to deposition: mineral dust and combustion processes. Atmospheric dissolution of insoluble to soluble iron is parameterized by an acidic interstitial aerosol reaction and a separate in-cloud aerosol reaction scheme based on observations of enhanced aerosol iron solubility in the presence of oxalate. Updates include a more comprehensive treatment of combustion iron emissions, improvements to the iron dissolution scheme, and an improved physical dust mobilization scheme. An extensive dataset consisting predominantly of cruise-based observations was compiled to compare to the model. The annual mean modelled concentration of surface-level total iron compared well with observations but less so in the soluble fraction (iron solubility) for which observations are much more variable in space and time. Comparing model and observational data is sensitive to the definition of the average as well as the temporal and spatial range over which it is calculated. Through statistical analysis and examples, we show that a median or log-normal distribution is preferred when comparing with soluble iron observations. The iron solubility calculated at each model time step versus that calculated based on a ratio of the monthly mean values, which is routinely presented in aerosol studies and used in ocean biogeochemistry models, is on average globally one-third (34\&thinsp;\%) higher. We redefined ocean deposition regions based on dominant iron emission sources and found that the daily variability in soluble iron simulated by {MIMI} was larger than that of previous model simulations. {MIMI} simulated a general increase in soluble iron deposition to Southern Hemisphere oceans by a factor of 2 to 4 compared with the previous version, which has implications for our understanding of the ocean biogeochemistry of these predominantly iron-limited ocean regions.},

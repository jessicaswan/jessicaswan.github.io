	abstract = {Vertical and horizontal profiles from the North and South Pacific Oceans demonstrate the existence of three species of dissolved selenium: selenite, selenate, and organic selenide (operationally defined). In surface waters, organic selenide makes up about 80\% of the total dissolved selenium, selenite concentrations are uniformly low, and selenate concentrations rise with increased vertical mixing. The organic selenide maximum (thought to consist of seleno-amino acids in peptides) coincides with the maxima of primary productivity, pigments, bioluminescence, and dissolved free amino acids. Deep ocean waters are enriched in selenite and selenate, while organic selenide is nondetectable. In suboxic waters of the tropical northeastern Pacific, organic selenide concentrations rise, while selenite values decrease. The downward flux of particulate selenium generally decreases with depth, and fluxing particulate selenium is found to be primarily in the (−2) oxidation state. These data allow a re-evaluation of the internal biogeochemical cycle of selenium. This cycle includes selective uptake, reductive incorporation, particulate transport, a multistep regeneration, and kinetic stabilization of thermodynamically unstable species.},

This metaregression analysis i) summarizes direct links between adverse climatic events and migration, ii) maps patterns of climate migration, and iii) explains the variation in outcomes. Using a set of limited dependent variable models, we meta-analyze thus-far the most comprehensive sample of 3,625 estimates from 116 original studies and produce novel insights on climate migration. We find that extremely high temperatures and drying conditions increase migration. We do not find a significant effect of sudden-onset events. Climate migration is most likely to emerge due to contemporaneous events, to originate in rural areas and to take place in middle-income countries, internally, to cities. The likelihood to become trapped in affected areas is higher for women and in low-income countries, particularly in Africa. We uniquely quantify how pitfalls typical for the broader empirical climate impact literature affect climate migration findings. We also find evidence of different publication biases.},

	doi = {10.1029/2007GB002964},
	abstract = {Iron is hypothesized to be an important micronutrient for ocean biota, thus modulating carbon dioxide uptake by the ocean biological pump. Studies have assumed that atmospheric deposition of iron to the open ocean is predominantly from mineral aerosols. For the first time we model the source, transport, and deposition of iron from combustion sources. Iron is produced in small quantities during fossil fuel burning, incinerator use, and biomass burning. The sources of combustion iron are concentrated in the industrialized regions and biomass burning regions, largely in the tropics. Model results suggest that combustion iron can represent up to 50\% of the total iron deposited, but over open ocean regions it is usually less than 5\% of the total iron, with the highest values ({\textless}30\%) close to the East Asian continent in the North Pacific. For ocean biogeochemistry the bioavailability of the iron is important, and this is often estimated by the fraction which is soluble (Fe({II})). Previous studies have argued that atmospheric processing of the relatively insoluble Fe({III}) occurs to make it more soluble (Fe({II})). Modeled estimates of soluble iron amounts based solely on atmospheric processing as simulated here cannot match the variability in daily averaged in situ concentration measurements in Korea, which is located close to both combustion and dust sources. The best match to the observations is that there are substantial direct emissions of soluble iron from combustion processes. If we assume observed soluble Fe/black carbon ratios in Korea are representative of the whole globe, we obtain the result that deposition of soluble iron from combustion contributes 20–100\% of the soluble iron deposition over many ocean regions. This implies that more work should be done refining the emissions and deposition of combustion sources of soluble iron globally.},

This review presents an integration of available observations of atmospheric iron and iron deposition, and also covers bioavailable iron distributions. Methods for estimating temporal variability in ocean deposition over the recent past are reviewed. Desert dust iron is estimated to represent 95\% of the global atmospheric iron cycle, and combustion sources of iron are responsible for the remaining 5\%. Humans may be significantly perturbing desert dust (up to 50\%). The sources of bioavailable iron are less well understood than those of iron, partly because we do not know what speciation of the iron is bioavailable. Bioavailable iron can derive from atmospheric processing of relatively insoluble desert dust iron or from direct emissions of soluble iron from combustion sources. These results imply that humans could be substantially impacting iron and bioavailable iron deposition to ocean regions, but there are large uncertainties in our understanding.},

Based on results from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC} {AR}4), we updated previous studies of implications of climate change on {PNW} hydrology. {PNW} 21st century hydrology was simulated using 20 Global Climate Models ({GCMs}) and 2 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios over Washington and the greater Columbia River watershed, with additional focus on the Yakima River watershed and the Puget Sound which are particularly sensitive to climate change. We evaluated projected changes in snow water equivalent ({SWE}), soil moisture, runoff, and streamflow for A1B and B1 emissions scenarios for the 2020s, 2040s, and 2080s. April 1 {SWE} is projected to decrease by approximately 38–46\% by the 2040s (compared with the mean over water years 1917–2006), based on composite scenarios of B1 and A1B, 226 Climatic Change (2010) 102:225–260 respectively, which represent average effects of all climate models. In three relatively warm transient watersheds west of the Cascade crest, April 1 {SWE} is projected to almost completely disappear by the 2080s. By the 2080s, seasonal streamflow timing will shift significantly in both snowmelt dominant and rain–snow mixed watersheds. Annual runoff across the State is projected to increase by 2–3\% by the 2040s; these changes are mainly driven by projected increases in winter precipitation.},

These models project increases in annual temperature of, on average, 1.1 • C (2.0 • F) by the 2020s, 1.8 • C (3.2 • F) by the 2040s, and 3.0 • C (5.3 • F) by the 2080s, compared with the average from 1970 to 1999, averaged across all climate models. Rates of warming range from 0.1 • C to 0.6 • C (0.2 • F to 1.0 • F) per decade. Projected changes in annual precipitation, averaged over all models, are small (+1\% to +2\%), but some models project an enhanced seasonal cycle with changes toward wetter autumns and winters and drier summers. Changes in nearshore sea surface temperatures, though smaller than on land, are likely to substantially exceed interannual variability, but coastal upwelling changes little. Rates of twenty-first century sea level rise will depend on poorly known factors like ice sheet instability in Greenland and Antarctica, and could be as low as twentieth century values (20 cm, 8) or as large as 1.3 m (50).},

	abstract = {[1] Changes in desert area due to humans have important implications from a local, regional to global level. Here I focus on the latter in order to better understand estimated changes in desert dust aerosols and the associated iron deposition into oceans. Using 17 model simulations from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model dataset and the {BIOME}4 equilibrium vegetation model, I estimate changes in desert dust source areas due to climate change and carbon dioxide fertilization. If I assume no carbon dioxide fertilization, the mean of the model predictions is that desert areas expand from the 1880s to the 2080s, due to increased aridity. If I allow for carbon dioxide fertilization, the desert areas become smaller. Thus better understanding carbon dioxide fertilization is important for predicting desert response to climate. There is substantial spread in the model simulation predictions for regional and global averages. Citation: Mahowald, N. M.

We conducted annual surveys of rocky reef communities that varied in the recovery of a keystone predator (sea otter, Enhydra lutris) and the mass mortality of a mesopredator (sunflower sea star, Pycnopodia helianthoides) due to an infectious wasting disease. By fitting a population model to empirical data, we show that sea otters had the greatest impact on the mortality of large sea urchins, but that Pycnopodia decline corresponded to a 311\% increase in medium urchins and a 30\% decline in kelp densities. Our results reveal that predator complementarity in size-selective prey consumption strengthens top-down control on urchins, affecting the resilience of alternative reef states by reinforcing the resilience of kelp forests and eroding the resilience of urchin barrens. We reveal previously underappreciated species interactions within a 'classic' trophic cascade and regime shift, highlighting the critical role of middle-level predators in mediating rocky reef state transitions.},

In laboratory experiments, time between development of disease signs and death was influenced by temperature in adults but not juveniles and adult mortality was 18\% higher in the 19°C treatment compared to the lower temperature treatments. While larger ochre stars developed disease signs sooner than juveniles, diseased juveniles died more quickly than diseased adults. Unusual 2–3°C warm temperature anomalies were coincident with the summer 2014 mortalities. We suggest these warm waters could have increased the disease progression and mortality rates of {SSWD} in Washington State.},

In previous studies Trametes versicolor has been reported to produce higher activities of {MnP}, followed by laccase and {LiP}. Lignocellulosic substrates including wheat straw, rice straw, banana stalks, corncobs, corn stover, and sugarcane bagasse were used in solid state fermentation ({SSF}) for the production of ligninases including peroxidase ({LiP}), manganese peroxidase ({MnP}), and laccase by Trametes versicolor {IBL}-04. Maximum production of {MnP} (998 U/{mL}), {LiP} (620 U/{mL}), and Laccase (49.7 U/{mL}) was observed after 5 days in the {SSF} medium containing 5g rice straw (60\% w/w moisture) in still culture {SSF}. Moisture, {pH}, temperature, inoculums size, additional carbon and nitrogen sources, and surfactants had a significant influence on ligninase synthesis by the fungus. Production of ligninases was substantially enhanced by optimizing {SSF} production process. Maximum {MnP} (1775 U/{mL}), {LiP} (1663 U/{mL}), and laccase (99 U/{mL}) were produced when rice straw (5g) at 66.6 \% moisture (w/w) receiving 5ml inoculum was incubated at {pH} 4.0 and 30 degrees C in the presence of maltose (1\% w/w) as carbon source, urea (0.2\% w/w) as nitrogen source and 1mM Tween-80 (0.3 ml) as surfactant.},

	abstract = {Decaying dead wood density measurements are a useful indicator for multiple purposes, such as for estimating the amount of carbon in dead wood and making predictions of potential diversity of dead wood inhabiting fungi and insects. Currently, qualitative decay phases are used as wood density estimates in many applications, since measuring the density is labori- ous. A quantitative measure of density would, however, be preferred over the qualitative one. Penetrometers, which are commonly used for measuring the density of standing trees, might also be applicable to dead wood density measurements. We tested the device for making quick, quantitative measurements of decaying logs. The penetrometer measures the depth into which a pre-loaded spring forces a pin in the wood. We tested pins of 5 and 10 mm diameter together with an original 2.5 mm pin and compared the results with gravimetric density measurements of the sample logs. Our results suggest that the standard pin works for less decayed wood, but for more decomposed wood, the thicker 5 mm pin gave more reliable estimates when the penetration measures were converted to densities with a linear regression function (R2=0.62, F=82.9, p=0.000). The range of wood densities successfully measured with the 5 mm pin was from 180 to 510 kg m–3. With the 10 mm pin, the measuring resolution of denser wood was compromised, while the improvement at the other end of density scale was not large. As a conclusion, the penetrometer seems to be a promising tool for quick density testing of decaying logs in field, but it needs to be modified to use a thicker measuring pin than the standard 2.5 mm pin.},

This paper reviews how three valued services have, and will continue to, shift under climate change: (1) capture fisheries, (2) food from aquaculture, and (3) protection from coastal hazards such as storms and sea-level rise. Climate adaptation planning is just beginning for fisheries, aquaculture production, and risk mitigation for coastal erosion and inundation. A few examples are highlighted, showing the promise of considering multiple ecosystem services in developing approaches to adapt to sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and rising sea temperatures. Ecosystem-based adaptation in fisheries and along coastlines and changes in aquaculture practices can improve resilience of species and habitats to future environmental challenges. Opportunities to use market incentives - such as compensation for services or nutrient trading schemes - are relatively untested in marine systems. Relocation of communities in response to rising sea levels illustrates the urgent need to manage human activities and investments in ecosystems to provide a sustainable flow of benefits in the face of future climate change. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Due to the wide range of fishery characteristics, including different goals of fisheries management across regions and species, theoretical best practices for {EBFM} vary greatly. Here we highlight the lack of consensus in the interpretation of {EBFM} amongst professionals in marine science and its implementation. Fisheries policy-makers and managers, stock assessment scientists, conservationists, and ecologists had very dif- ferent opinions on the degree to which certain management strategies would be considered {EBFM}.Wethen assess the variability of the implementation of {EBFM}, where we created a checklist of characteristics typifying {EBFM} and scored fisheries across different regions, species, ecosystems, and fishery size and capacity. Our assessments show fisheries are unlikely to meet all the criteria on the {EBFM} checklist. Consequentially, it is unnecessary for management to practice all the traits of {EBFM}, as some may be disparate from the ecosys- tem attributes or fishery goals. Instead, incorporating some ecosystem-based consider- ations to fisheries management that are context-specific is a more realistic and useful way for {EBFM} to occur in practice.},

chrysosporium) was performed on the degradation of 10 mg L1 of ibuprofen ({IBU}, anti-inflammatory), 
clofibric acid ({CLOFI}, lipid regulator) and carbamazepine ({CARBA}, antiepileptic/analgetic) after 7 d 
of incubation. Whereas {IBU} was extensively degraded by all the fungi tested, T. versicolor was the only 
strain able to degrade either {CLOFI} (91\%) and {CARBA} (58\%), although the latter was also degraded 
by G. lucidum (47\%). In vitro experiments using manganese peroxidase and laccase-mediator system 
showed that extracellular fungal enzyme systems did not appear to play a role in the first step of degradation. 
However, our in vivo studies using the cytochrome P450 inhibitors 1-aminobenzotriazole and 
piperonyl butoxide suggested that the cytochrome P450 system may be involved in the first step of {CLOFI} 
and {CARBA} oxidation by T. versicolor. During the very early stages of {IBU} degradation by T. versicolor, two 
hydroxylated metabolites were detected: 1-hydroxy ibuprofen and 2-hydroxy ibuprofen. These byproducts 
were subsequently degraded by the fungus to 1,2-dihydroxy ibuprofen, that was not reported in biological 
systems to date. Furthermore, these results are of particular interest because {CLOFI} and {CARBA} are 
highly persistent in the aquatic environment and they pass unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater

	abstract = {{AbstractRegional} patterns of aerosol radiative forcing are important for understanding climate change on decadal time scales. Uncertainty in aerosol forcing is likely to vary regionally and seasonally because of the short aerosol lifetime and heterogeneous emissions. Here the sensitivity of regional aerosol cloud albedo effect ({CAE}) forcing to 31 aerosol process parameters and emission fluxes is quantified between 1978 and 2008. The effects of parametric uncertainties on calculations of the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation are found to be spatially and temporally dependent. Regional uncertainty contributions of opposite sign cancel in global-mean forcing calculations, masking the regional importance of some parameters. Parameters that contribute little to uncertainty in Earth?s global energy balance during recent decades make significant contributions to regional forcing variance. Aerosol forcing sensitivities are quantified within 11 climatically important regions, where surface temperatures are thought to influence large-scale climate effects. Substantial simulated uncertainty in {CAE} forcing in the eastern Pacific leaves open the possibility that apparent shifts in the mean {ENSO} state may result from a forced aerosol signal on multidecadal time scales. A likely negative aerosol {CAE} forcing in the tropical North Atlantic calls into question the relationship between Northern Hemisphere aerosol emission reductions and {CAE} forcing of sea surface temperatures in the main Atlantic hurricane development region on decadal time scales. Simulated {CAE} forcing uncertainty is large in the North Pacific, suggesting that the role of the {CAE} in altering Pacific tropical storm frequency and intensity is also highly uncertain.},

Improved characterisation of natural emissions and their radiative effects can therefore increase the accuracy of global climate model projections.

Revised global model simulations predict a 35\% reduction in the calculated global mean cloud albedo forcing over the Industrial Era (1750–2000 {CE}) compared to estimates using emissions data from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. An estimated upper limit to pre-industrial fire emissions results in a much greater (91\%) reduction in forcing.

	abstract = {Light absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere and cryosphere play an important role in the climate system. Their presence in ambient air and snow changes radiative properties of these media, thus contributing to increased atmospheric warming and snowmelt. High spatio-temporal variability of aerosol concentrations and a shortage of long-term observations contribute to large uncertainties in properly assigning the climate effects of aerosols through time. Starting around 1860 {AD}, many glaciers in the European Alps began to retreat from their maximum mid-19th century terminus positions, thereby visualizing the end of the Little Ice Age in Europe. Radiative forcing by increasing deposition of industrial black carbon to snow has been suggested as the main driver of the abrupt glacier retreats in the Alps. Basis for this hypothesis were model simulations using elemental carbon concentrations at low temporal resolution from two ice cores in the Alps. Here we present sub-annually resolved, well-replicated concentration records of refractory black carbon ({rBC}; using soot photometry) as well as distinctive tracers for mineral dust, biomass burning and industrial pollution from the Colle Gnifetti ice core in the Alps from 1741\&ndash;2015 {AD}. These records allow precise assessment of a potential relation between the timing of observed acceleration of glacier melt in the mid-19th century with an increase of {rBC} deposition on the glacier caused by the industrialization of Western Europe. Our study reveals that in 1875 {AD}, the time when European {rBC} emission rates started to significantly increase, the majority of Alpine glaciers had already experienced more than 80\&thinsp;\% of their total 19th century length reduction. Industrial {BC} emissions can, therefore, not been considered as the primary forcing for the rapid deglaciation at the end of the Little Ice Age in the Alps. {BC} records from the Alps and Greenland also reveal the limitations of bottom-up emission inventories to represent a realistic evolution of anthropogenic {BC} emissions since preindustrial times.},

The focus is hereby not on the technical challenges but rather on the surrounding sustainability issues. Bio-{CCS} shows significant potential to achieve net {CO}2 removal from the atmosphere at a cost that is comparable to conventional {CCS} technologies. However, uncertainties remain due to the little experience with large-scale Bio-{CCS} demonstration plants, gaps in climate policies and accounting frameworks, missing financial instruments, unclear public acceptance and complex sustainability issues. A major conclusion is that the deployment of Bio-{CCS} cannot take place in isolation, thus will require an approach addressing the inextricable links within the food-water-energy-climate nexus.},

	abstract = {Strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through forestry activities have been proposed, but ecosystem process-based integration of climate change, enhanced {CO} 2 , disturbance from fire, and management actions at regional scales are extremely limited. Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation , management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon's net ecosystem carbon balance ({NECB}) was equivalent to 72\% of total emissions in 2011-2015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires. Reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increase {NECB} 56\% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Resultant cobenefits included water availability and biodiversity, primarily from increased forest area, age, and species diversity. Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests could decrease irrigation demand by 233 billion m 3 ·y −1. Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products. Hence, temperate forests with high carbon densities and lower vulnerability to mortality have substantial potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Our analysis framework provides a template for assessments in other temperate regions. forests {\textbar} carbon balance {\textbar} greenhouse gas emissions {\textbar} climate mitigation S trategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through forestry activities have been proposed, but regional assessments to determine feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness are limited and rarely account for the interactive effects of future climate, atmospheric {CO} 2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, disturbance from wildfires, and management actions on forest processes. We examine the net effect of all of these factors and a suite of mitigation strategies at fine resolution (4-km grid). Proven strategies immediately available to mitigate carbon emissions from forest activities include the following: (i) reforestation (growing forests where they recently existed), (ii) afforestation (growing forests where they did not recently exist), (iii) increasing carbon density of existing forests , and (iv) reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (1). Other proposed strategies include wood bioenergy production (2-4), bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage ({BECCS}), and increasing wood product use in buildings. However, examples of commercial-scale {BECCS} are still scarce, and sustainability of wood sources remains controversial because of forgone ecosystem carbon storage and low environmental cobenefits (5, 6). Carbon stored in buildings generally outlives its usefulness or is replaced within decades (7) rather than the centuries possible in forests, and the factors influencing product substitution have yet to be fully explored (8). Our analysis of mitigation strategies focuses on the first four strategies, as well as bioenergy production, utilizing harvest residues only and without carbon capture and storage. The appropriateness and effectiveness of mitigation strategies within regions vary depending on the current forest sink, competition with land-use and watershed protection, and environmental conditions affecting forest sustainability and resilience. Few process-based regional studies have quantified strategies that could actually be implemented, are low-risk, and do not depend on developing technologies. Our previous studies focused on regional modeling of the effects of forest thinning on net ecosystem carbon balance ({NECB}) and net emissions, as well as improving modeled drought sensitivity (9, 10), while this study focuses mainly on strategies to enhance forest carbon. Our study region is Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, where coastal and montane forests have high biomass and carbon se-questration potential. They represent coastal forests from northern California to southeast Alaska, where trees live 800 y or more and biomass can exceed that of tropical forests (11) (Fig. S1). The semiarid ecoregions consist of woodlands that experience frequent fires (12). Land-use history is a major determinant of forest carbon balance. Harvest was the dominant cause of tree mortality (2003-2012) and accounted for fivefold as much mortality as that from fire and beetles combined (13). Forest land ownership is predominantly public (64\%), and 76\% of the biomass harvested is on private lands. Significance Regional quantification of feasibility and effectiveness of forest strategies to mitigate climate change should integrate observations and mechanistic ecosystem process models with future climate , {CO} 2 , disturbances from fire, and management. Here, we demonstrate this approach in a high biomass region, and found that reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increased net ecosystem carbon balance by 56\% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Forest sector emissions tracked with our life cycle assessment model decreased by 17\%, partially meeting emissions reduction goals. Harvest residue bioenergy use did not reduce short-term emissions. Cobenefits include increased water availability and biodiversity of forest species. Our improved analysis framework can be used in other temperate regions.},

	title = {Coal Versus Biomass Electricity Generation -Comparing Environmental Implications Using Life Cycle Assessment},
	abstract = {A life cycle assessment ({LCA}) on coal-fired power systems has been conducted to assess the environmental effects on a cradle-to-grave basis. Three different designs were studied: 1) a plant that represents the average emissions from coal-fired power plants in the U.S. today, 2) a plant that meets the New Source Performance Standards ({NSPS}), and 3) an advanced plant incorporating a low emission boiler system ({LEBS}). The boundaries of the analysis include all material and energy streams from the following three subsystems: coal mining, transportation, and electricity generation. Upstream processes required for the operation of these main subsystems were also included. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to minimize the risk of imperfect data, to account for variations in data, and to cover alternate processing steps/routes. Ultimately, the resulting emissions, resource consumption, and energy requirements are compared to the results of the recently completed {LCA} for a biomass gasification combine-cycle power system. This allows us to quantify the environmental benefits and drawbacks of biomass power compared to the option that currently makes up the lion's share of generation technology in the U.S. today. This study sets the stage for future studies of coal and biomass cofiring plants. This paper details the methodology used in the coal study and compares the results with those obtained from the previous {LCA} of an advanced biomass power system.},

	abstract = {{ACTION} • On December 16, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency ({EPA}) signed a rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants. Specifically, these mercury and air toxics standards ({MATS}) for power plants will reduce emissions from new and existing coal-and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units ({EGUs}). o {EPA} also signed revisions to the new source performance standards ({NSPS}) for fossil-fuel-fired {EGUs}. This {NSPS} revises the standards that new coal-and oil-fired power plants must meet for particulate matter ({PM}), sulfur dioxide ({SO}2), and nitrogen oxides ({NOx}). • {MATS} will reduce emissions of heavy metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni); and acid gases, including hydrochloric acid ({HCl}) and hydrofluoric acid ({HF}). These toxic air pollutants, also known as hazardous air pollutants or air toxics, are known or suspected of causing cancer and other serious health effects. • Power plants are the largest source of U.S. mercury emissions to the air. Once mercury from the air reaches water, microorganisms can change it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish. People are primarily exposed to mercury by eating contaminated fish. o Methylmercury exposure is a particular concern for women of childbearing age, unborn babies, and young children because studies have linked high levels of methylmercury to damage to the developing nervous system, which can impair children's ability to think and learn. o Mercury and other power plant emissions also damage the environment. Toxics pollute our nation's lakes and streams and contaminate fish. • Other toxic metals emitted from power plants, such as arsenic, chromium and nickel, can cause cancer. Reducing toxic power plant emissions will also cut {SO}2 and fine particle pollution, which will reduce particle concentrations in the air we breathe and prevent thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of heart attacks, bronchitis cases and asthma episodes. • The final {MATS} rule is mostly unchanged from proposal. We used new information from the public comment process to adjust some aspects of the rule but the approach and methodology remain the same. Key changes include: o Some emissions limits are adjusted, including using filterable {PM} as a surrogate for the metal toxics limit o Revised definition of coal subcategories o Added subcategories for non-continental oil-fired units and limited use oil-fired units o Improved monitoring provisions for clarity and consistency; and o Provided an alternative compliance option for sources that plan to comply by averaging across multiple units.},

	abstract = {Congress designed the Clean Air Act to protect public health and welfare from different types of air pollution caused by a diverse array of pollution sources. Congress established the law's basic structure in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, and made major revisions in 1977 and 1990. The Act contains key provisions to control common pollutants which, at the time of the 1970 amendments, formed dense, visible smog in many of the nation's cities and industrial centers. To protect public health and welfare nationwide, the law requires {EPA} to establish national ambient air quality standards based on the latest science, and requires states to adopt enforceable plans to achieve the standards. State plans also must control emissions that drift across state lines and harm air quality in downwind states. Congress designed the law to minimize pollution increases from growing numbers of motor vehicles, and from new or expanded stationary sources (i.e., power plants, industrial plants, and other facilities that are not mobile). The law calls for new stationary sources to be built with best technology, and allows less stringent standards for existing stationary sources. The Act also contains specific provisions to address:  "Hazardous" or "toxic" air pollutants that pose health risks such as cancer or environmental threats such as bioaccumulation of heavy metals,  Acid rain that damages aquatic life and ecosystems, acidifies forest soils, damages property, and forms from pollution that degrades visibility and harms public health.  Chemical emissions that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer which protects us from skin cancer and eye damage, and  Regional haze that impairs visibility in national parks and other recreational areas. In addition, Congress drafted the Act with general authorities that can be used to address pollution problems that emerge over time, such as greenhouse gases that cause climate change.},

	doi = {10.1002/2016RG000533},
	abstract = {Over the coming century humanity may need to find reservoirs to store several trillions of tons of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emitted from fossil fuel combustion, which would otherwise cause dangerous climate change if it were left in the atmosphere. Carbon storage in the ocean as bicarbonate ions (by increasing ocean alkalinity) has received very little attention. Yet recent work suggests sufficient capacity to sequester copious quantities of {CO}2. It may be possible to sequester hundreds of billions to trillions of tons of C without surpassing postindustrial average carbonate saturation states in the surface ocean. When globally distributed, the impact of elevated alkalinity is potentially small and may help ameliorate the effects of ocean acidification. However, the local impact around addition sites may be more acute but is specific to the mineral and technology. The alkalinity of the ocean increases naturally because of rock weathering in which {\textgreater}1.5 mol of carbon are removed from the atmosphere for every mole of magnesium or calcium dissolved from silicate minerals (e.g., wollastonite, olivine, and anorthite) and 0.5 mol for carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite and dolomite). These processes are responsible for naturally sequestering 0.5 billion tons of {CO}2 per year. Alkalinity is reduced in the ocean through carbonate mineral precipitation, which is almost exclusively formed from biological activity. Most of the previous work on the biological response to changes in carbonate chemistry have focused on acidifying conditions. More research is required to understand carbonate precipitation at elevated alkalinity to constrain the longevity of carbon storage. A range of technologies have been proposed to increase ocean alkalinity (accelerated weathering of limestone, enhanced weathering, electrochemical promoted weathering, and ocean liming), the cost of which may be comparable to alternative carbon sequestration proposals (e.g., \$20–100 {tCO}2−1). There are still many unanswered technical, environmental, social, and ethical questions, but the scale of the carbon sequestration challenge warrants research to address these.},

In particular, we observed as much as a 10(5)-fold increase in {OH}(-) concentration ({pH} increase of up to 5.3 units) relative to experimental controls following the electrolysis of 0.25 M Na2SO4 solutions when the anode was encased in powdered silicate mineral, either wollastonite or an ultramafic mineral. After electrolysis, full equilibration of the alkalized solution with air led to a significant {pH} reduction and as much as a 45-fold increase in dissolved inorganic carbon concentration. This demonstrated significant spontaneous air {CO}2 capture, chemical conversion, and storage as a bicarbonate, predominantly as {NaHCO}3. The excess {OH}(-) initially formed in these experiments apparently resulted via neutralization of the anolyte acid, H2SO4, by reaction with the base mineral silicate at the anode, producing mineral sulfate and silica. This allowed the {NaOH}, normally generated at the cathode, to go unneutralized and to accumulate in the bulk electrolyte, ultimately reacting with atmospheric {CO}2 to form dissolved bicarbonate. Using nongrid or nonpeak renewable electricity, optimized systems at large scale might allow relatively high-capacity, energy-efficient ({\textless}300 {kJ}/mol of {CO}2 captured), and inexpensive ({\textless}\$100 per tonne of {CO}2 mitigated) removal of excess air {CO}2 with production of carbon-negative H2.

carbon ({BC}) and primary organic carbon ({OC}) emitted from North America
and Asia. Direct and indirect radiative forcing ({DRF} and {IRF}) of {BC} and
{OC} are simulated with {CAM}5.1. Two diagnostics are introduced to aid
policy-relevant discussions: linearity and emission-normalized forcing.
{DRF} is linearly related to emission for both {BC} and {OC} from two regions,
and the linear relationship is similar, within 15\%. {IRF} is linear in
emissions when emissions are lower and regions are far from sources
(North American {BC} and {OC}). Indirect radiative forcing is sublinear for
strong sources and near-source regions (Asian {OC}). Emission-normalized
{IRF} in North America is two to four times higher than that in Asia. The
difference among regions and species is primarily caused by particle
density as high density of {BC} results in fewer emitted particles and by
the processes for accumulation mode particles to become cloud
condensation nuclei and then to activate into cloud droplet. Lower
emission-normalized {IRF} in more polluted regions means that reductions
of {OC} in these regions would be relatively climate-neutral rather than
causing significant warming via {IRF} reduction. An optimal aggregation
area (30 degrees x30 degrees) is identified for analysis of the
forcing-to-emission relationship. For {IRF}, only 15-40\% of the Earth's
surface is significantly affected by an emission region, but forcing in
these regions comprises most of the global impact. Emission-normalized
forcing can be used to estimate forcing changes due to emission
reductions, as long as causes of nonlinearity are identified and
considered.},

Most studies focusing on calculating the radiative forcing and other climate impacts of fire aerosols use monthly mean emissions derived from the Global Fire Emissions Database that captures only the seasonal cycle of fire aerosol emissions. Here we present the results of a sensitivity study that investigates the climate response to the episodicity of the fires, based on the standard approach which releases emissions every day, and contrasts that to the response when fires are represented as intense pulses of emissions that occur only over 1–2 days on a monthly, yearly, or five-yearly basis. Overall we find that in the modified cases with increased levels of episodicity, the all sky direct effect radiative forcing increases, the clear sky direct effect radiative forcing remains relatively constant, and the magnitude of the indirect effect radiative forcing decreases by about 1 W m$^{\textrm{\&amp;minus;2}}$ (from −1.6 to −0.6 W m$^{\textrm{\&amp;minus;2}}$). In the long term, we find that an increase in aerosol emission episodicity leads to an asymmetric change in indirect radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere contributes to a slight shift in the annual average position of the intertropical convergence zone ({ITCZ}). This shift is found to have a mixed effect on the overall performance of the model at predicting precipitation rates in the tropics. Given these results we conclude that future studies that look to assess the present day global climate impacts of fire aerosols should consider the need to accurately represent fire episodicity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

One line of inquiry has investigated whether reducing climate-warming soot or black carbon aerosol emissions can form a viable component of mitigating global warming. We review and acknowledge scientific arguments against considering aerosols and greenhouse gases in a common framework, including the differences in the physical mechanisms of climate change and relevant time scales. We argue that such a joint consideration is consistent with the language of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We synthesize results from published climate-modeling studies to obtain a global warming potential for black carbon relative to that of {CO}2 (680 on a 100 year basis). This calculation enables a discussion of cost-effectiveness for mitigating the largest sources of black carbon. We find that many emission reductions are either expensive or difficult to enact when compared with greenhouse gases, particularly in Annex I countries. Finally, we propose a role for black carbon in climate mitigation strategies that is consistent with the apparently conflicting arguments raised during our discussion. Addressing these emissions is a promising way to reduce climatic interference primarily for nations that have not yet agreed to address greenhouse gas emissions and provides the potential for a parallel climate agreement.},

	abstract = {Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr-1in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m-2with 90\% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m-2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m-2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m-2with 90\% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m-2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m-2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to +1.08) W m-2during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m-2with 90\% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m-2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates. ©2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol particles serve as condensation nuclei for the formation of both, cloud droplets and atmospheric ice particles. As a result, they exert a substantial influence on the microphysical properties of water and ice clouds, which in turn affect the processes that lead to the formation of rain, snow, hail, and other forms of precipitation. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the chemical composition of aerosols, their microphysical properties, and the factors that enable them to act as cloud condensation nuclei ({CCN}) and ice nuclei ({IN}). The first part of this review article will focus on the nature and sources of {CCN} and {IN}. We discuss the fundamentals of the cloud droplet and ice nucleation processes, and the role that the chemical composition and particle size play in this process. We show that, in many instances, the influence of chemical composition can be represented by a simple parameterization, which leaves particle size as the main variable controlling {CCN} efficiency. Aerosol particles are produced either directly by anthropogenic and natural sources (dust, sea salt, soot, biological particles, etc.), or they are formed in the atmosphere by condensation of low-volatility compounds (e.g., sulfuric acid or oxidized organic compounds). We discuss the magnitude of these sources, and the {CCN} and {IN} characteristics of the particles they produce. In contrast to previous assessments, which focused on the aerosol mass, we are emphasizing the number of particles being produced, as this is the key variable in cloud microphysics. Large uncertainties still exist for many aerosol sources, e.g., the submicron part of the seaspray aerosol, the particles produced by the biosphere, and the secondary organic aerosol. We conclude with a discussion on what particle concentrations may have been in the pristine atmosphere, before the onset on anthropogenic pollution. Model calculations and observations in remote continental regions consistently suggest that {CCN} concentrations over the pristine continents were similar to those now prevailing over the remote oceans, suggesting that human activities have modified cloud microphysics more than what is reflected in conventional wisdom. The second part of this review will address the effects of changing {CCN} and {IN} abundances on precipitation processes, the water cycle, and climate. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, 'pre-industrial' was not defined. Here we investigate the implications of different choices of the pre-industrial baseline on the likelihood of exceeding these two temperature thresholds. We find that for the strongest mitigation scenario {RCP}2.6 and a medium scenario {RCP}4.5, the probability of exceeding the thresholds and timing of exceedance is highly dependent on the pre-industrial baseline; for example, the probability of crossing 1.5 °C by the end of the century under {RCP}2.6 varies from 61\% to 88\% depending on how the baseline is defined. In contrast, in the scenario with no mitigation, {RCP}8.5, both thresholds will almost certainly be exceeded by the middle of the century with the definition of the pre-industrial baseline of less importance. Allowable carbon emissions for threshold stabilization are similarly highly dependent on the pre-industrial baseline. For stabilization at 2 °C, allowable emissions decrease by as much as 40\% when earlier than nineteenth-century climates are considered as a baseline.},

Two {MAM} versions were developed: a more complete version with seven lognormal modes ({MAM}7), and a version with three lognormal modes ({MAM}3) for the purpose of long-term (decades to centuries) simulations. In this paper a description and evaluation of the aerosol module and its two representations are provided. Sensitivity of the aerosol lifecycle to simplifications in the representation of aerosol is discussed. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Simulated sulfate and secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) mass concentrations are remarkably similar between {MAM}3 and {MAM}7. Differences in primary organic matter ({POM}) and black carbon ({BC}) concentrations between {MAM}3 and {MAM}7 are also small (mostly within 10\%). The mineral dust global burden differs by 10\% and sea salt burden by 30–40\% between {MAM}3 and {MAM}7, mainly due to the different size ranges for dust and sea salt modes and different standard deviations of the log-normal size distribution for sea salt modes between {MAM}3 and {MAM}7. The model is able to qualitatively capture the observed geographical and temporal variations of aerosol mass and number concentrations, size distributions, and aerosol optical properties. However, there are noticeable biases; e.g., simulated {BC} concentrations are significantly lower than measurements in the Arctic. There is a low bias in modeled aerosol optical depth on the global scale, especially in the developing countries. These biases in aerosol simulations clearly indicate the need for improvements of aerosol processes (e.g., emission fluxes of anthropogenic aerosols and precursor gases in developing countries, boundary layer nucleation) and properties (e.g., primary aerosol emission size, {POM} hygroscopicity). In addition, the critical role of cloud properties (e.g., liquid water content, cloud fraction) responsible for the wet scavenging of aerosol is highlighted.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols play an important role in the climate system by influencing the Earth's radiation budgets and modifying the cloud properties. Despite the importance, their representations in large-scale atmospheric models are still crude, which can influence model simulated burden, lifetime, physical, chemical and optical properties, and the climate forcing of carbonaceous aerosols. In this study, we improve the current 3-mode version of modal aerosol module ({MAM}3) in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 ({CAM}5) by introducing an additional primary carbon mode to explicitly account for the microphysical ageing of primary carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere. Compared to {MAM}3, the 4-mode version of {MAM} ({MAM}4) significantly increases the column burdens of primary particulate organic matter ({POM}) and black carbon ({BC}) by up to 40 \% in many remote regions, where in-cloud scavenging plays an important role in determining the aerosol concentrations. Differences in the column burdens for other types of aerosol (e.g., sulfate, secondary organic aerosols, mineral dust, sea salt) are less than 1 \%. Evaluating the {MAM}4 simulation against in situ surface and aircraft observations, we find that {MAM}4 significantly improves the simulation of seasonal variation of {BC} concentrations in the polar regions, by increasing the {BC} concentrations in all seasons and particularly in cold seasons. However, it exacerbates the overestimation of modeled {BC} concentrations in the upper troposphere in the Pacific regions. The comparisons suggest that, to address the remaining model {POM} and {BC} biases, future improvements are required related to (1) in-cloud scavenging and vertical transport in convective clouds and (2) emissions of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols.},

	abstract = {Wildfires represent a major source for aerosols impacting atmospheric radiation, atmospheric chemistry and cloud micro-physical properties. Although former studies indicated that the height of the aerosol–radiation interaction crucially affects the overall climate impact, the importance of fire emission heights in particular remains to be quantified. In this study we use the general circulation model {ECHAM}6 extended by the aerosol module {HAM}2 to investigate the impact of wildfire emission heights on atmospheric long-range transport, Black Carbon ({BC}) concentrations and atmospheric radiation. We simulate the wildfire aerosol release using either various versions of a semi-empirical plume height parametrization or prescribed standard emission heights in {ECHAM}6-{HAM}2. Extreme scenarios of near-surface or free-tropospheric only injections provide lower and upper constraints on the emission height climate impact. We find relative changes in mean global atmospheric {BC} burden of up to 7.9±4.4\% caused by average changes in emission heights of 1.5–3.5 km. Regionally, changes in {BC} burden exceed 30–40\% in the major biomass burning regions. The model evaluation of Aerosol Optical Thickness ({AOT}) against {MODIS}, {AERONET} and {CALIOP} observations indicates that the implementation of a plume height parametrization slightly reduces the {ECHAM}6-{HAM}2 biases regionally, but on the global scale these improvements in model performance are small. For prescribed emission release at the surface, wildfire emissions entail a total sky Top Of Atmosphere ({TOA}) Radiative Forcing ({RF}) of \&minus;0.16±0.06 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$. The application of a plume height parametrization which agrees reasonably well with observations introduces a slightly stronger negative {TOA} {RF} of \&minus;0.20±0.07 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$. The standard {ECHAM}6-{HAM}2 model in which 25\% of the wildfire emissions are injected into the free troposphere and 75\% into the planetary boundary layer, leads to a {TOA} {RF} of \&minus;0.24±0.06 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$. Overall, we conclude that simple plume height parametrizations provide sufficient representations of emission heights for global climate modeling. Significant improvements in aerosol wildfire modeling likely depend on better emission inventories and aerosol process modeling rather than on improved emission height parametrizations.},

	abstract = {Natural aerosols define a preindustrial baseline state from which the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate are calculated and are a major component of the large uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol-cloud radiative forcing. This uncertainty would be reduced if aerosol environments unperturbed by air pollution could be studied in the present--day atmosphere, but the pervasiveness of air pollution makes identification of unperturbed regions difficult. Here, we use global model simulations to define unperturbed aerosol regions in terms of two measures that compare 1750 and 2000 conditions-the number of days with similar aerosol concentrations and the similarity of the aerosol response to perturbations in model processes and emissions. The analysis shows that the aerosol system in many present-day environments looks and behaves like it did in the preindustrial era. On a global annual mean, unperturbed aerosol regions cover 12\% of the Earth (16\% of the ocean surface and 2\% of the land surface). There is a strong seasonal variation in unperturbed regions of between 4\% in August and 27\% in January, with the most persistent conditions occurring over the equatorial Pacific. About 90\% of unperturbed regions occur in the Southern Hemisphere, but in the Northern Hemisphere, unperturbed conditions are transient and spatially patchy. In cloudy regions with a radiative forcing relative to 1750, model results suggest that unperturbed aerosol conditions could still occur on a small number of days per month. However, these environments are mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, potentially limiting the usefulness in reducing Northern Hemisphere forcing uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Changes in aerosols cause a change in net top-of-the-atmosphere ({ToA}) short-wave and long-wave radiative fluxes, rapid adjustments in clouds, water vapour and temperature, and cause an effective radiative forcing ({ERF}) of the planetary energy budget. The diverse sources of model uncertainty and the computational cost of running climate models make it difficult to isolate the main causes of aerosol {ERF} uncertainty and to understand how observations can be used to constrain it. We explore the aerosol {ERF} uncertainty by using fast model emulators to generate a very large set of aerosol-climate model variants that span the model uncertainty due to twenty-seven parameters related to atmospheric and aerosol processes. Sensitivity analyses shows that the uncertainty in the {ToA} flux is dominated (around 80\&thinsp;\%) by uncertainties in the physical atmosphere model, particularly parameters that affect cloud reflectivity. However, uncertainty in the change in {ToA} flux caused by aerosol emissions over the industrial period (the aerosol {ERF}) is controlled by a combination of uncertainties in aerosol (around 60\&thinsp;\%) and physical atmosphere (around 40\&thinsp;\%) parameters. Four of the atmospheric and aerosol parameters that cause uncertainty in short-wave {ToA} flux (mostly parameters that directly scale cloud reflectivity, cloud water content or cloud droplet concentrations) also account for around 60\% of the aerosol {ERF} uncertainty. The common causes of uncertainty mean that constraining the modelled planetary brightness to tightly match satellite observations changes the lower 95\&thinsp;\% credible aerosol {ERF} value from \&minus;2.65\&thinsp;Wm\&minus;2 to \&minus;2.37\&thinsp;Wm\&minus;2. This suggests the strongest forcings (below around \&minus;2.4\&thinsp;Wm\&minus;2) are inconsistent with observations. These results show that, regardless of the fact that the {ToA} flux is an order of magnitude larger than the aerosol {ERF}, the observed flux can constrain the uncertainty in {ERF} because their values are connected by constrainable process parameters. The key to reducing the aerosol {ERF} uncertainty further will be to identify observations that can additionally constrain individual parameter ranges and/or combined parameter effects, which can be achieved through sensitivity analysis of perturbed parameter ensembles.},

While local studies have found more fires close to settlements and roads, assimilated charcoal records and analyses of regional fire patterns from remote-sensing observations point to a decline in fire frequency with increasing human population. Here, we present a global analysis using three multi-year satellite-based burned-area products combined with a parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis with a non-linear model. We show that at the global scale, the impact of increasing population density is mainly to reduce fire frequency. Only for areas with up to 0.1 people per km 2 , we find that fire frequency increases by 10 to 20 \% relative to its value at no population. The results are robust against choice of burned-area data set, and indicate that at only very few places on earth, fire frequency is limited by human ignitions. Applying the results to historical population estimates results in a moderate but accelerating decline of global burned area by around 14 \% since 1800, with most of the decline since 1950.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are by far the largest contributor to global biomass burning and constitute a large global source of atmospheric traces gases and aerosols. Such emissions have a considerable impact on air quality and constitute a major health hazard. Biomass burning also influences the ra-diative balance of the atmosphere and is thus not only of societal , but also of significant scientific interest. There is a common perception that climate change will lead to an increase in emissions as hot and dry weather events that promote wild-fire will become more common. However, even though a few studies have found that the inclusion of {CO} 2 fertilisation of photosynthesis and changes in human population patterns will tend to somewhat lower predictions of future wildfire emissions, no such study has included full ensemble ranges of both climate predictions and population projections, including the effect of different degrees of urbanisation. Here, we present a series of 124 simulations with the {LPJ}-{GUESS}-{SIMFIRE} global dynamic vegetation-wildfire model, including a semi-empirical formulation for the prediction of burned area based on fire weather, fuel continuity and human population density. The simulations use Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 ({CMIP}5) climate predictions from eight Earth system models. These were combined with two Representative Concentration Pathways ({RCPs}) and five scenarios of future human population density based on the series of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSPs}) to assess the sensitivity of emissions to the effect of climate, {CO} 2 and humans. In addition, two alternative parameterisations of the semi-empirical burned-area model were applied. Contrary to previous work, we find no clear future trend of global wildfire emissions for the moderate emissions and climate change scenario based on the {RCP} 4.5. Only historical population change introduces a decline by around 15 \% since 1900. Future emissions could either increase for low population growth and fast urbanisation, or continue to decline for high population growth and slow urbanisation. Only for high future climate change ({RCP}8.5), wildfire emissions start to rise again after ca. 2020 but are unlikely to reach the levels of 1900 by the end of the 21st century. We find that climate warming will generally increase the risk of fire, but that this is only one of several equally important factors driving future levels of wildfire emissions, which include population change, {CO} 2 fertilisation causing woody thickening, increased productivity and fuel load and faster litter turnover in a warmer climate.},

One way of assessing the impacts of global wildfire on centennial to multi-millennial timescales is to use process-based fire models linked to dynamic global vegetation models ({DGVMs}). Here we present an update to the {LPJ}-{DGVM} and a new fire module based on {SPITFIRE} that includes several improvements to the way in which fire occurrence, behaviour, and the effects of fire on vegetation are simulated. The new {LPJ}-{LMfire} model includes explicit calculation of natural ignitions, the representation of multi-day burning and coa-lescence of fires, and the calculation of rates of spread in different vegetation types. We describe a new representation of anthropogenic biomass burning under preindustrial conditions that distinguishes the different relationships between humans and fire among hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and farmers. We evaluate our model simulations against remote-sensing-based estimates of burned area at regional and global scale. While wildfire in much of the modern world is largely influenced by anthropogenic suppression and ignitions, in those parts of the world where natural fire is still the dominant process (e.g. in remote areas of the boreal forest and subarctic), our results demonstrate a significant improvement in simulated burned area over the original {SPITFIRE}. The new fire model we present here is particularly suited for the investigation of climate-human-fire relationships on multi-millennial timescales prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example , the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project ({FireMIP}) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage.

The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58 \% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia.

Wildfire smoke contains numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects from this exposure. Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings. Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure. Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality. More research is needed to clarify which causes of mortality may be associated with wildfire smoke, whether cardiovascular outcomes are associated with wildfire smoke, and if certain populations are more susceptible.},

Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western {US} forests over the past several decades and, during 2000-2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({\textgreater}1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western {US} forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984-2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence.

We estimate levels of fine particulate matter ({PM} 2.5) directly attributable to wildfires in 561 western {US} counties during fire seasons for the present-day (2004-2009) and future (2046-2051), using a fire prediction model and {GEOS}-Chem, a 3-D global chemical transport model. Future estimates are obtained under a scenario of moderately increasing greenhouse gases by mid-century. We create a new term {BSmoke} Wave,{\textasciicircum} defined as ≥2 consecutive days with high wildfire-specific {PM} 2.5 , to describe episodes of high air pollution from wildfires. We develop an interactive map to demonstrate Climatic Change (2016) 138:655-666 the counties likely to suffer from future high wildfire pollution events. For 2004-2009, on days exceeding regulatory {PM} 2.5 standards, wildfires contributed an average of 71.3 \% of total {PM} 2.5. Under future climate change, we estimate that more than 82 million individuals will experience a 57 \% and 31 \% increase in the frequency and intensity, respectively, of Smoke Waves. Northern California, Western Oregon and the Great Plains are likely to suffer the highest exposure to widlfire smoke in the future. Results point to the potential health impacts of increasing wildfire activity on large numbers of people in a warming climate and the need to establish or modify {US} wildfire management and evacuation programs in high-risk regions. The study also adds to the growing literature arguing that extreme events in a changing climate could have significant consequences for human health.},

Particle size and mixing state determine the solar absorption efficiency of {BC} and also strongly influence how effectively {BC} is removed, but they have large uncertainties. Here we use a multiple-mixing-state global aerosol microphysics model and show that the sensitivity (range) of present-day {BC} direct radiative effect, due to current uncertainties in emission size distributions, is amplified 5–7 times (0.18–0.42 W m−2) when the diversity in {BC} mixing state is sufficiently resolved. This amplification is caused by the lifetime, core absorption, and absorption enhancement effects of {BC}, whose variability is underestimated by 45–70\% in a single-mixing-state model representation. We demonstrate that reducing uncertainties in emission size distributions and how they change in the future, while also resolving modeled {BC} mixing state diversity, is now essential when evaluating {BC} radiative effects and the effectiveness of {BC} mitigation on future temperature changes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Herein, we present the description of the Mechanism of Intermediate complexity for Modelling Iron ({MIMI}). This iron processing module was developed for use within Earth system models and has been updated within a modal aerosol framework from the original implementation in a bulk aerosol model. {MIMI} simulates the emission and atmospheric processing of two main sources of iron in aerosol prior to deposition: mineral dust and combustion processes. Atmospheric dissolution of insoluble to soluble iron is parametrized by an acidic interstitial reaction and a separate in-cloud reaction scheme based on observations of enhanced aerosol iron solubility in the presence of oxalate. Updates include a more comprehensive treatment of combustion iron emissions, improvements to the iron dissolution scheme, and an improved physical dust mobilization scheme. An extensive dataset consisting predominantly of cruise-based observations was compiled to compare to the model. The annual mean modelled concentration of surface-level total iron compared well with observations, but less so in the soluble fraction where observations are much more variable in space and time. Comparing model and observational data is sensitive to the definition of the average and the temporal and spatial range over which it is calculated. Through statistical analysis and examples, we show that a median or log-normal distribution is preferred when comparing with soluble iron observations. We redefined ocean deposition regions based on dominant iron emission sources and found that the daily variability in soluble iron simulated by {MIMI} was larger than that of previous model simulations. {MIMI} simulated a general increase in soluble iron deposition to Southern Hemisphere oceans by a factor of two to four compared with the previous version, which has implications for our understanding of the ocean biogeochemistry of these predominantly iron limited ocean regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	isbn = {978-0-309-48452-7},
	abstract = {As understanding of the risks and damages of climate change has improved, almost all nations have committed to limit total global warming to less than 2°C over preindustrial levels, with an aspirational target of 1.5°C. Meeting a 2°C target is becoming exceedingly challenging; the global mean temperature has already risen about 1°C over the 20th century. Most climate and integrated assessment models project that the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2) would have to stop increasing (and perhaps start decreasing) by the second half of the century for there to be a reasonable chance of limiting warming and the associated dangerous climate impacts. Fossil fuel consumption, agriculture, land-use change, and cement production are the dominant anthropogenic sources of {CO}2 to the atmosphere. The focus of climate mitigation is to reduce energy sector emissions by 80-100\%, requiring massive deployment of low-carbon technologies between now and 2050. Progress toward these targets could be made by deploying Negative Emissions Technologies ({NETs}), which remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it. Under the present conditions, where fossil {CO}2 is continuously added to the atmosphere, removing {CO}2 from the atmosphere and storing it has exactly the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously preventing emission of an equal amount of {CO}2. {NETs} have been part of the portfolio to achieve net emissions reductions, at least since reforestation, afforestation, and soil sequestration were brought into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, albeit as mitigation options, more than two decades ago. Recent analyses found that deploying {NETs} may be less expensive and less disruptive than reducing some emissions, such as a substantial portion of agricultural and land-use emissions and some transportation emissions. In 2015, the National Academies published Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration, which described and initially assessed {NETs} and sequestration technologies. This report acknowledged the relative paucity of research on {NETs} and recommended development of a research agenda that covers all aspects of {NETs} from fundamental science to full-scale deployment. To address this need, the National Academies convened the Committee on Developing a Research Agenda for Carbon Dioxide Removal and Sequestration to assess the benefits, risks, and “sustainable scale potential” for {NETs} and sequestration and to define the essential components of a research and development program, including its estimated costs and potential impact (Box S.1). The full Statement of Task is presented in Box 1.3. The committee held a series of public workshops and meetings to inform its deliberations and the writing of this report. {MITIGATION}},

Sensitivity experiments with an ocean circulation and biogeochemistry model illustrates the impacts of the wind and buoyancy forcings under a warming climate. Intensified and poleward shifted westerly wind strengthens the upper overturning circulation, not only leading to an increased uptake of anthropogenic {CO}2 but also releasing biologically regenerated carbon to the atmosphere. Freshening of Antarctic Surface Water causes a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to an increased Southern Ocean biological carbon storage. The rectified effect of these processes operating together is the sustained growth of the carbon storage in the Southern Ocean, even under the warming climate with a weaker global ocean carbon uptake.},

Compared to ship-based {CO}2 flux estimates, the float-based fluxes find significantly stronger outgassing in the zone around Antarctica where carbon-rich deep waters upwell to the surface ocean. Although interannual variability contributes, this difference principally stems from the lack of autumn and winter ship-based observations in this high-latitude region.

In this study, we use recent advances in the parameterization of air-sea oxygen fluxes to analyze 9 years of oxygen data from a recalibrated Argo oxygen data set and from air-calibrated oxygen floats deployed as part of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling ({SOCCOM}) project. From this combined data set of 150 floats, we find a total Southern Ocean oxygen sink of −183 ± 80 Tmol yr−1 (positive to the atmosphere), greater than prior estimates. The uptake occurs primarily in the Polar-Frontal Antarctic Zone ({PAZ}, −94 ± 30 Tmol O2 yr−1) and Seasonal Ice Zone ({SIZ}, −111 ± 9.3 Tmol O2 yr−1). This flux is driven by wintertime ventilation, with a large portion of the flux in the {SIZ} passing through regions with fractional sea ice. The Subtropical Zone ({STZ}) is seasonally driven by thermal fluxes and exhibits a net outgassing of 47 ± 29 Tmol O2 yr−1 that is likely driven by biological production. The Subantarctic Zone ({SAZ}) uptake is −25 ± 12 Tmol O2 yr−1. Total oxygen fluxes were separated into a thermal and nonthermal component. The nonthermal flux is correlated with net primary production and mixed layer depth in the {STZ}, {SAZ}, and {PAZ}, but not in the {SIZ} where seasonal sea ice slows the air-sea gas flux response to the entrainment of deep, low-oxygen waters.},

To characterize the role of {LCPAT}1 in lung cancer, we conducted the current study. Methods: Expression of {LCPAT}1 and autophagy-associated markers in tumor tissues and lung cancer cell lines was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR}). Hematoxylin and eosin ({HE}) staining, {qPCR}, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate xenografted tumor tissues. Autophagy induced by rapamycin was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence in lung cancer cell lines. Results: Expression of {LCPAT}1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta ({LC}3B) was positively correlated in lung cancer. Knockdown of {LCPAT}1 inhibited tumor growth and suppressed cell autophagy in vivo. Moreover, {LCPAT}1 knockdown in lung cancer cell lines resulted in decreased autophagy-associated gene expression and alleviated the cell autophagy induced by rapamycin. Conclusions: We speculate that {LCPAT}1 plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy in lung cancer.},

Aerosols partially offset the forcing of the {WMGHGs} and dominate the uncertainty associated with the total anthropogenic driving of climate change. As in previous {IPCC} assessments, {AR}5 uses the radiative forcing ({RF}) concept, but it also introduces effective radiative forcing ({ERF}). The {RF} concept has been used for many years and in previous {IPCC} assessments for evaluating and comparing the strength of the various mechanisms affecting the Earth\&\#x0027;s radiation balance and thus causing climate change. Whereas in the {RF} concept all surface and tropospheric conditions are kept fixed, the {ERF} calculations presented here allow all physical variables to respond to perturbations except for those concerning the ocean and sea ice. The inclusion of these adjustments makes {ERF} a better indicator of the eventual temperature response. {ERF} and {RF} values are significantly different for anthropogenic aerosols owing to their influence on clouds and on snow cover. These changes to clouds are rapid adjustments and occur on a time scale much faster than responses of the ocean (even the upper layer) to forcing. {RF} and {ERF} are estimated over the Industrial Era from 1750 to 2011 if other periods are not explicitly stated.},

While addressing known limitations of {MERRA}, {MERRA}-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis ({IESA}) currently under development at {GMAO}. This paper provides an overview of the {MERRA}-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in {MERRA}-2 relevant to {IESA} are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of {MERRA}-2 compared with {MERRA} include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified.

	abstract = {• Despite the ubiquitous presence of ericoid mycorrhizal ({ERM}) fungi in cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), no prior studies have examined the effect of {ERM} colonization on influx kinetics. • Here, 15NO 3- influx was measured in nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal cranberry in hydroponics. Mycorrhizal cranberry were inoculated with the {ERM} fungus Rhizoscyphus (syn. Hymenoscyphus) ericae. 15NO 3- influx by R. ericae in solution culture was also measured. • Rhizoscyphus ericae {NO}3- influx kinetics were linear when mycelium was exposed for 24 h to 3.8 mm {NH}4+, and saturable when pretreated with 3.8 mm {NO}3-, 50 μm, {NO}3- or 50 μm {NH} 4+. Both low-N pretreatments induced greater {NO} 3- influx than either of the high-N pretreatments. Nonmycorrhizal cranberry exhibited linear {NO}3- influx kinetics. By contrast, mycorrhizal cranberry had saturable {NO}3- influx kinetics, with c. eightfold greater {NO}3- influx than nonmycorrhizal cranberry at {NO}3- concentrations from 20 μm to 2 mm. There was no influence of pretreatments on cranberry {NO}3- influx kinetics, regardless of mycorrhizal status. • Inoculation with R. ericae increased the capacity of cranberry to utilize {NO}3--N. This finding is significant both for understanding the potential nutrient niche breadth of cranberry and for management of cultivated cranberry when irrigation water sources contain nitrate. © The Authors (2007).},

Cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) evolved in low-nutrient peat bogs, and {ERM} symbioses often occur in nutrient-poor environments where N is limiting. We investigated {ERM} symbiosis, resorption rates, as well as leaf litter quality and decomposition to infer N conservation strategies in cultivated cranberry plants. We expected moderate to high resorption rates and low leaf litter decomposition rates. We also expected to find evidence of {ERM} fungi mediating N uptake. Resorption rates (35.7 {AE} 3.5\% [s.e.]) were moderate, and the resulting cranberry leaf litter had high C:N ratios (56.9 {AE} 0.02). Decomposition was slow with 57 {AE} 2\% of initial leaf litter mass remaining at the end of 2.5 years. The negative d 15 N values of cranberry leaves (À2.61 {AE} 0.27\&) and positive d 15 N values of cranberry roots (1.04 {AE} 0.35\&) suggest that N uptake was mediated by {ERM} fungi as 14 N is preferred over 15 N during transfer from mycorrhizal fungi to host plant. We demonstrated that even in this intensively managed and fertilized agroecosystem, cranberry plants retain N conservation strategies observed in wildland cranberry ecosystems, namely high resorption efficiencies, low-quality leaf litter, and active {ERM} symbiosis. This study has management implications, since current nutrient plans mainly focus on inorganic N fertilizer regulation and do not recognize the role of {ERM} fungi in mediating N uptake.},

Fungicide treatment for fruit diseases did not appear to affect mycorrhizal colonization of cranberry roots. Soil layering in the root zone incited by regular sanding had a significant effect on mycorrhizal colonization; colonization decreased with increasing depth in the root zone soil.

	volume = {82},
	url = {http://canjbot.nrc.ca},
	doi = {10.1139/B04-123},
	abstract = {The importance of mycorrhizas in heathland and boreal forest biomes, which together cover much of the landmass of the Northern Hemisphere and store most of the global stocks of carbon, is reviewed. The taxonomic affinities of the organisms forming these symbiotic partnerships are assessed, and the distinctive structural features of the ericoid mycorrhizas of heathland dwarf shrubs and the ectomycorrhizas of boreal forest trees are described. It is stressed that neither in terms of the geographical distribution of the plants nor in terms of the occurrence of their characteristic mycorrhizas in the soil profile should these biomes be considered to be mutually exclusive. What unites them is their apparent affinity for acidic organic soils of inherently low accessibility of the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These properties relate directly to the nature of the nutrient-poor recalcitrant litter produced by their host plants and through positive-feedback mechanisms that are reinforced by selective removal of labile nutrients by the mycorrhizas. We suggest that coevolution of these plant litter traits with mycorrhizal associations that are adapted to them has been one of the defining features of these ecosystems. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi have biochemical and physiological attributes that make them highly efficient at scavenging for organic sources of N and P in surface soil horizons. In so doing, they restrict supplies of these elements to the decomposer communities. Case studies involving exploitation of N and P in defined organic substrates are described. In both biomes the dominant plants depend upon the abilities of their fungal partners to recover nutrients, so the symbioses control nutrient cycles, productivity, species composition, and functioning of these ecosystems. It is in this context that the fungal symbionts are here considered to be drivers of nutritional processes in their respective biomes. Through their influences upon the quality of carbon residues mycorrhizal fungi must also affect the sink-source balance for this key element in soil. There is an urgent need for the evaluation of the relative contributions of symbiotic and saprotrophic components of the microflora to the processes of carbon storage and cycling in these biomes, particularly in the context of global climate change and impacts of anthropogenic pollutant N deposition. Résumé : Cette revue porte sur l'importance des mycorhizes dans les biomes des tourbières et des forêts boréales, qui couvrent ensemble une grande partie des masses continentales de l'hémisphère nord et cumulent une majeure partie des réserves globales du carbone. Les auteurs évaluent les affinités taxonomiques des organismes qui forment ces partena-riats symbiotiques, et décrivent les caractéristiques structurales propres aux mycorhizes éricoïdes des arbustes nains des tourbières, et aux ectomycorhizes des arbres de la forêt boréale. On insiste sur le fait qu'on ne doit en aucune façon considérer ces deux biomes comme mutuellement exclusifs, que ce soit sur la base de la distribution géographique des plantes, ou de la présence de leurs mycorhizes caractéristiques dans le profil de sol. Ce qui les unis est leur apparente affinité pour les sols organiques acides avec leur inaccessibilité inhérente aux nutriments majeurs, l'azote (N) et le phosphore (P). Ces propriétés sont directement reliées à la nature des litières récalcitrantes pauvres en nutriments pro-duites par leurs plantes hôtes, laquelle, par des mécanismes de rétroaction positive, est renforcée par l'élimination sé-lective des nutriments labiles via les mycorhizes. Les auteurs suggèrent que la coévolution de ces caractéristiques des litières végétales avec des associations symbiotiques qui leurs sont adaptées, a été une des caractéristiques définissant ces écosystèmes. Les champignons éricoïdes et ectomycorhiziens ont des propriétés biochimiques et physiologiques qui les rendent hautement efficaces à récupérer les sources organiques de N et de P dans les horizons de surface du sol. Ce faisant, ils limitent la disponibilité de ces nutriments pour la communauté des décomposeurs. On décrit des cas d'espèce impliquant l'exploitation du N et du P dans des substrats organiques définis. Dans les deux biomes, les plan-tes dominantes dépendent de la capacité de leurs partenaires fongiques à récupérer les nutriments, de sortes que les symbioses contrôlent les cycles nutritifs, la productivité, la composition en espèces et le fonctionnement des écosystè-mes. Par leurs influences sur la qualité des résidus carbonés, les champignons mycorhiziens doivent également affecter 1243 la balance source-puit pour cet élément clé. Il y a un urgent besoin qu'on évalue la contribution relative des compo-santes saprophytiques et symbiotiques de la microflore aux processus de l'accumulation et du cyclage du carbone dans ces biomes, surtout dans le contexte du changement global du climat et des impacts liés à la déposition de polluants N d'origine anthropique.},

	abstract = {Data mining for a phylogenetic study including the prominent ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoscyphus ericae revealed nearly identical {ITS} sequences of the bryophilous Hyaloscypha hepaticicola suggesting they are conspecific. Additional genetic markers and a broader taxonomic sampling furthermore suggested that the sexual Hyaloscypha and the asexual Meliniomyces may be congeneric. In order to further elucidate these issues, type strains of all species traditionally treated as members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae aggregate ({REA}) and related taxa were subjected to phylogenetic analyses based on {ITS}, {nrLSU}, {mtSSU}, and rpb2 markers to produce comparable datasets while an in vitro re-synthesis experiment was conducted to examine the root-symbiotic potential of H. hepaticicola in the Ericaceae. Phylogenetic evidence demonstrates that sterile root-associated Meliniomyces, sexual Hyaloscypha and Rhizoscyphus, based on R. ericae, are indeed congeneric. To this monophylum also belongs the phialidic dematiaceous hyphomycetes Cadophora finlandica and Chloridium paucisporum. We provide a taxonomic revision of the {REA}; Meliniomyces and Rhizoscyphus are reduced to synonymy under Hyaloscypha. Pseudaegerita, typified by P. corticalis, an asexual morph of H. spiralis which is a core member of Hyaloscypha, is also transferred to the synonymy of the latter genus. Hyaloscypha melinii is introduced as a new root-symbiotic species from Central Europe. Cadophora finlandica and C. paucisporum are confirmed conspecific, and four new combinations in Hyaloscypha are proposed. Based on phylogenetic analyses, some sexually reproducing species can be attributed to their asexual counterparts for the first time whereas the majority is so far known only in the sexual or asexual state. Hyaloscypha bicolor sporulating in vitro is reported for the first time. Surprisingly, the mycological and mycorrhizal sides of the same coin have never been formally associated, mainly because the sexual and asexual morphs of these fungi have been studied in isolation by different research communities. Evaluating all these aspects allowed us to stabilize the taxonomy of a widespread and ecologically well-studied group of root-associated fungi and to link their various life-styles including saprobes, bryophilous fungi, root endophytes as well as fungi forming ericoid mycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae.},

	abstract = {Aerosols from biomass burning ({BB}) emissions are poorly constrained in global and regional models, resulting in a high level of uncertainty in understanding their impacts. In this study, we compared six {BB} aerosol emission datasets for 2008 globally as well as in 14 regions. The six {BB} emission datasets are (1) {GFED}3.1 (Global Fire Emissions Database version 3.1), (2) {GFED}4s ({GFED} version 4 with small fires), (3) {FINN}1.5 ({FIre} {INventory} from {NCAR} version 1.5), (4) {GFAS}1.2 (Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2), (5) {FEER}1.0 (Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0), and (6) {QFED}2.4 (Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.4). The global total emission amounts from these six {BB} emission datasets differed by a factor of 3.8, ranging from 13.76 to 51.93 Tg for organic carbon and from 1.65 to 5.54 Tg for black carbon. In most of the regions, {QFED}2.4 and {FEER}1.0, which are based on satellite observations of fire radiative power ({FRP}) and constrained by aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}), yielded higher {BB} aerosol emissions than the rest by a factor of 2-4. By comparison, the {BB} aerosol emissions estimated from {GFED}4s and {GFED}3.1, which are based on satellite burned-area data, without {AOD} constraints, were at the low end of the range. In order to examine the sensitivity of model-simulated {AOD} to the different {BB} emission datasets, we ingested these six {BB} emission datasets separately into the same global model, the {NASA} Goddard Earth Observing System ({GEOS}) model, and compared the simulated {AOD} with observed {AOD} from the {AErosol} {RObotic} {NETwork} ({AERONET}) and the Multiangle Imaging Spec-{troRadiometer} ({MISR}) in the 14 regions during 2008. In Southern Hemisphere Africa ({SHAF}) and South America ({SHSA}), where aerosols tend to be clearly dominated by smoke in September, the simulated {AOD} values were underestimated in almost all experiments compared to {MISR}, except for the {QFED}2.4 run in {SHSA}. The model-simulated {AOD} values based on {FEER}1.0 and {QFED}2.4 were the closest to the corresponding {AERONET} data, being, respectively , about 73 \% and 100 \% of the {AERONET} observed {AOD} at Alta Floresta in {SHSA} and about 49 \% and 46 \% at Mongu in {SHAF}. The simulated {AOD} based on the other four {BB} emission datasets accounted for only ∼ 50 \% of the {AERONET} {AOD} at Alta Floresta and ∼ 20 \% at Mongu. Overall, during the biomass burning peak seasons, at most of the selected {AERONET} sites in each region, the {AOD} values simulated with {QFED}2.4 were the highest and closest to {AERONET} and {MISR} observations, followed closely by {FEER}1.0. However, the {QFED}2.4 run tends to overestimate {AOD} in the region of {SHSA}, and the {QFED}2.4 {BB} emission dataset is tuned with the {GEOS} model. In contrast, the {FEER}1.0 {BB} emission dataset is derived in a more model-independent fashion and is more physically based since its Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 970 X. Pan et al.: Six global biomass burning emission datasets emission coefficients are independently derived at each grid box. Therefore, we recommend the {FEER}1.0 {BB} emission dataset for aerosol-focused hindcast experiments in the two biomass-burning-dominated regions in the Southern Hemisphere , {SHAF}, and {SHSA} (as well as in other regions but with lower confidence). The differences between these six {BB} emission datasets are attributable to the approaches and input data used to derive {BB} emissions, such as whether {AOD} from satellite observations is used as a constraint, whether the approaches to parameterize the fire activities are based on burned area, {FRP}, or active fire count, and which set of emission factors is chosen.},

	abstract = {Fires and the aerosols that they emit impact air quality, health, and climate, but the abundance and properties of carbonaceous aerosol (both black carbon and organic carbon) from biomass burning ({BB}) remain uncertain and poorly constrained. We aim to explore the uncertainties associated with fire emissions and their air quality and radiative impacts from underlying dry matter consumed and emissions factors. To investigate this, we compare model simulations from a global chemical transport model, {GEOS}-Chem, driven by a variety of fire emission inventories with surface and airborne observations of black carbon ({BC}) and organic aerosol ({OA}) concentrations and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth ({AOD}). We focus on two fire-detection-based and/or burned-area-based ({FD}-{BA}) inventories using burned area and active fire counts, respectively , i.e., the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 ({GFED}4s) with small fires and the Fire {INventory} from {NCAR} version 1.5 ({FINN}1.5), and two fire radiative power ({FRP})-based approaches, i.e., the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.4 ({QFED}2.4) and the Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 ({GFAS}1.2). We show that, across the inventories, emissions of {BB} aerosol ({BBA}) differ by a factor of 4 to 7 over North America and that dry matter differences, not emissions factors, drive this spread. We find that simulations driven by {QFED}2.4 generally overestimate {BC} and, to a lesser extent, {OA} concentrations observations from two fire-influenced aircraft campaigns in North America ({ARCTAS} and {DC}3) and from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments ({IMPROVE}) network, while simulations driven by {FINN}1.5 substantially underestimate concentrations. The {GFED}4s and {GFAS}1.2-driven simulations provide the best agreement with {OA} and {BC} mass concentrations at the surface ({IMPROVE}), {BC} observed aloft ({DC}3 and {ARCTAS}), and {AOD} observed by {MODIS} over North America. We also show that a sensitivity simulation including an enhanced source of secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) from fires, based on the {NOAA} Fire Lab 2016 experiments, produces substantial additional {OA}; however, the spread in the primary emissions estimates implies that this magnitude of {SOA} can be neither confirmed nor ruled out when comparing the simulations against the observations explored here. Given the substantial uncertainty in fire emissions, as repre-Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 2074 T. S.

We also show that the range in the estimated global direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosol from fires (−0.11 to −0.048 W m −2) is large and comparable to the direct radia-tive forcing of {OA} (−0.09 W m −2) estimated in the Fifth Assessment Report ({AR}5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}). Our analysis suggests that fire emissions uncertainty challenges our ability to accurately characterize the impact of smoke on air quality and climate.},

Previous studies report a large underestimation of {AOD} over regions impacted by tropical biomass burning, scaling particulate emissions from fire by up to a factor of 6 to enable the models to simulate observed {AOD}. To explore the uncertainty in emissions we use three satellite-derived fire emission datasets ({GFED}3, {GFAS}1 and {FINN}1). In these datasets the tropics account for 66-84 \% of global particulate emissions from fire. With all emission datasets {GLOMAP} underestimates dry season {PM} 2.5 concentrations in regions of high fire activity in South America and underestimates {AOD} over South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. When we assume an upper estimate of aerosol hygro-scopicity, underestimation of {AOD} over tropical regions im-pacted by biomass burning is reduced relative to previous studies. Where coincident observations of surface {PM} 2.5 and {AOD} are available we find a greater model underestimation of {AOD} than {PM} 2.5 , even when we assume an upper estimate of aerosol hygroscopicity. Increasing particulate emissions to improve simulation of {AOD} can therefore lead to overesti-mation of surface {PM} 2.5 concentrations. We find that scaling {FINN}1 emissions by a factor of 1.5 prevents underestimation of {AOD} and surface {PM} 2.5 in most tropical locations except Africa. {GFAS}1 requires emission scaling factor of 3.4 in most locations with the exception of equatorial Asia where a scaling factor of 1.5 is adequate. Scaling {GFED}3 emissions by a factor of 1.5 is sufficient in active deforestation regions of South America and equatorial Asia, but a larger scaling factor is required elsewhere. The model with {GFED}3 emissions poorly simulates observed seasonal variability in surface {PM} 2.5 and {AOD} in regions where small fires dominate, providing independent evidence that {GFED}3 underestimates particulate emissions from small fires. Seasonal variability in both {PM} 2.5 and {AOD} is better simulated by the model using {FINN}1 emissions. Detailed observations of aerosol properties over biomass burning regions are required to better constrain particulate emissions from fires.},

	abstract = {Vegetation fires emit large quantities of aerosol into the atmosphere, impacting regional air quality and climate. Previous work has used comparisons of simulated and observed aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) in regions heavily im-pacted by fires to suggest that emissions of aerosol particles from fires may be underestimated by a factor of 2-5. Here we use surface, aircraft and satellite observations made over the Amazon during September 2012, along with a global aerosol model to improve understanding of aerosol emissions from vegetation fires. We apply three different satellite-derived fire emission datasets ({FINN}, {GFED}, {GFAS}) in the model. Daily mean aerosol emissions in these datasets vary by up to a factor of 3.7 over the Amazon during this period , highlighting the considerable uncertainty in emissions. We find variable agreement between the model and observed aerosol mass concentrations. The model reproduces observed aerosol concentrations over deforestation fires well in the western Amazon during dry season conditions with {FINN} or {GFED} emissions and during dry-wet transition season conditions with {GFAS} emissions. In contrast, the model underestimates aerosol concentrations over savanna fires in the Cer-rado environment east of the Amazon Basin with all three fire emission datasets. The model generally underestimates {AOD} compared to satellite and ground stations, even when the model reproduces the observed vertical profile of aerosol mass concentration. We suggest it is likely caused by uncertainties in the calculation of {AOD}, which are as large as ∼ 90 \%, with the largest sensitivities due to uncertainties in water uptake and relative humidity. Overall, we do not find evidence that particulate emissions from fires are systematically underestimated in the Amazon region and we caution against using comparison with {AOD} to constrain particulate emissions from fires.},

	abstract = {Fires and the aerosols that they emit impact air quality, health, and climate, but the abundance and properties of carbonaceous aerosol (both black carbon and organic carbon) from biomass burning ({BB}) remain uncertain and poorly constrained. We aim to explore the uncertainties associated with fire emissions and their air quality and radiative impacts from underlying dry matter consumed and emissions factors. To investigate this, we compare model simulations from a global chemical transport model, {GEOS}-Chem, driven by a variety of fire emission inventories with surface and airborne observations of black carbon ({BC}) and organic aerosol ({OA}) concentrations and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth ({AOD}). We focus on two fire-detection-based and/or burned-area-based ({FD}-{BA}) inventories using burned area and active fire counts, respectively , i.e., the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 ({GFED}4s) with small fires and the Fire {INventory} from {NCAR} version 1.5 ({FINN}1.5), and two fire radiative power ({FRP})-based approaches, i.e., the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.4 ({QFED}2.4) and the Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 ({GFAS}1.2). We show that, across the inventories, emissions of {BB} aerosol ({BBA}) differ by a factor of 4 to 7 over North America and that dry matter differences, not emissions factors, drive this spread. We find that simulations driven by {QFED}2.4 generally overestimate {BC} and, to a lesser extent, {OA} concentrations observations from two fire-influenced aircraft campaigns in North America ({ARCTAS} and {DC}3) and from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments ({IMPROVE}) network, while simulations driven by {FINN}1.5 substantially underestimate concentrations. The {GFED}4s and {GFAS}1.2-driven simulations provide the best agreement with {OA} and {BC} mass concentrations at the surface ({IMPROVE}), {BC} observed aloft ({DC}3 and {ARCTAS}), and {AOD} observed by {MODIS} over North America. We also show that a sensitivity simulation including an enhanced source of secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) from fires, based on the {NOAA} Fire Lab 2016 experiments, produces substantial additional {OA}; however, the spread in the primary emissions estimates implies that this magnitude of {SOA} can be neither confirmed nor ruled out when comparing the simulations against the observations explored here.

We also show that the range in the estimated global direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosol from fires (−0.11 to −0.048 W m −2) is large and comparable to the direct radia-tive forcing of {OA} (−0.09 W m −2) estimated in the Fifth Assessment Report ({AR}5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}). Our analysis suggests that fire emissions uncertainty challenges our ability to accurately characterize the impact of smoke on air quality and climate.},

However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the contribution of deforestation, sa-vanna, forest, agricultural waste, and peat fires to total global fire emissions. Here we used a revised version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach ({CASA}) biogeochemi-cal model and improved satellite-derived estimates of area burned, fire activity, and plant productivity to calculate fire emissions for the 1997-2009 period on a 0.5 • spatial resolution with a monthly time step. For November 2000 onwards , estimates were based on burned area, active fire detections , and plant productivity from the {MODerate} resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) sensor. For the partitioning we focused on the {MODIS} era. We used maps of burned area derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ({TRMM}) Visible and Infrared Scanner ({VIRS}) and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer ({ATSR}) active fire data prior to {MODIS} (1997-2000) and estimates of plant productivity derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ({AVHRR}) observations during the same period. Average global fire carbon emissions according to this version 3 of the Global Fire Emissions Database ({GFED}3) were 2.0 Pg C year −1 with significant interannual variability dur tively constant (around 2.1 Pg C year −1) before declining in 2008 (1.7 Pg C year −1) and 2009 (1.5 Pg C year −1) partly due to lower deforestation fire emissions in South America and tropical Asia. On a regional basis, emissions were highly variable during 2002-2007 (e.g., boreal Asia, South Amer-ica, and Indonesia), but these regional differences canceled out at a global level. During the {MODIS} era (2001-2009), most carbon emissions were from fires in grasslands and sa-vannas (44\%) with smaller contributions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires (20\%), woodland fires (mostly confined to the tropics, 16\%), forest fires (mostly in the ex-tratropics, 15\%), agricultural waste burning (3\%), and tropical peat fires (3\%). The contribution from agricultural waste fires was likely a lower bound because our approach for measuring burned area could not detect all of these relatively small fires. Total carbon emissions were on average 13\% lower than in our previous ({GFED}2) work. For reduced trace gases such as {CO} and {CH} 4 , deforestation, degradation, and peat fires were more important contributors because of higher emissions of reduced trace gases per unit carbon combusted compared to savanna fires. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, degradation, and peatland fires were on average 0.5 Pg C year −1. The carbon emissions from these fires may not be balanced by regrowth following fire. Our results provide the first global assessment of the contribution of different sources to total global fire emissions for the past decade, and supply the community with an improved 13-year fire emissions time series.},

	url = {www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/3515/2010/},
	abstract = {During El Niño years, fires in tropical forests and peatlands in equatorial Asia create large regional smoke clouds. We characterized the sensitivity of these clouds to regional drought, and we investigated their effects on climate by using an atmospheric general circulation model. Satellite observations during 2000-2006 indicated that El Niño-induced regional drought led to increases in fire emissions and, consequently, increases in aerosol optical depths over Sumatra, Borneo and the surrounding ocean. Next, we used the Community Atmosphere Model ({CAM}) to investigate how climate responded to this forcing. We conducted two 30 year simulations in which monthly fire emissions were prescribed for either a high (El Niño, 1997) or low (La Niña, 2000) fire year using a satellite-derived time series of fire emissions. Our simulations included the direct and semi-direct effects of aerosols on the radiation budget within the model. We assessed the radiative and climate effects of anthropogenic fire by analyzing the differences between the high and low fire simulations. Fire aerosols reduced net shortwave radiation at the surface during August-October by 19.1±12.9 W m −2 (10\%) in a region that encompassed most of Sumatra and Borneo (90 • E-120 • E, 5 • S-5 • N). The reductions in net shortwave radiation cooled sea surface temperatures ({SSTs}) and land surface temperatures by 0.5±0.3 and 0.4±0.2 • C during these months. Tropo-spheric heating from black carbon ({BC}) absorption averaged 20.5±9.3 W m −2 and was balanced by a reduction in latent heating. The combination of decreased {SSTs} and increased atmospheric heating reduced regional precipitation by 0.9±0.6 mm d −1 (10\%). The vulnerability of ecosystems to fire was enhanced because the decreases in precipitation Correspondence to: M. G. Tosca (mtosca@uci.edu) exceeded those for evapotranspiration. Together, the satellite and modeling results imply a possible positive feedback loop in which anthropogenic burning in the region intensifies drought stress during El Niño.},

	abstract = {The sentiment that woodsmoke, being a natural substance, must be benign to humans is still sometimes heard. It is now well established, however, that wood-burning stoves and fireplaces as well as wildland and agricultural fires emit significant quantities of known health-damaging pollutants, including several carcinogenic compounds. Two of the principal gaseous pollutants in woodsmoke, {CO} and {NOx}, add to the atmospheric levels of these regulated gases emitted by other combustion sources. Health impacts of exposures to these gases and some of the other woodsmoke constituents (e.g., benzene) are well characterized in thousands of publications. As these gases are indistinguishable no matter where they come from, there is no urgent need to examine their particular health implications in woodsmoke. With this as the backdrop, this review approaches the issue of why woodsmoke may be a special case requiring separate health evaluation through two questions. The first question we address is whether woodsmoke should be regulated and/or managed separately, even though some of its separate constituents are already regulated in many jurisdictions. The second question we address is whether woodsmoke particles pose different levels of risk than other ambient particles of similar size. To address these two key questions, we examine several topics: the chemical and physical nature of woodsmoke; the exposures and epidemiology of smoke from wildland fires and agricultural burning, and related controlled human laboratory exposures to biomass smoke; the epidemiology of outdoor and indoor woodsmoke exposures from residential woodburning in developed countries; and the toxicology of woodsmoke, based on animal exposures and laboratory tests. In addition, a short summary of the exposures and health effects of biomass smoke in developing countries is provided as an additional line of evidence. In the concluding section, we return to the two key issues above to summarize (1) what is currently known about the health effects of inhaled woodsmoke at exposure levels experienced in developed countries, and (2) whether there exists sufficient reason to believe that woodsmoke particles are sufficiently different to warrant separate treatment from other regulated particles. In addition, we provide recommendations for additional woodsmoke research. Copyright © Informa Healthcare.},

	volume = {503},
	doi = {10.1038/nature12674},
	abstract = {The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and radiative properties is the source of one of the largest uncertainties in the radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period. This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates. The impact of aerosol changes on cloud albedo (called the aerosol first indirect forcing) 1 is estimated 2 to exert a global mean radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period between 20.4 W m 22 and 21.8 W m 22. Other aerosol-cloud interaction effects, involving rapid adjustments, may be of comparable magnitude 3 but their radiative effects are even less well understood on a global scale 3,4. The uncertainty in the aerosol forcing is much larger than the uncertainty in the well-constrained positive forcing of 1.7 6 0.2 W m 22 that is due to carbon dioxide change. The aerosol indirect forcing therefore has a highly uncertain influence on climate change and has the potential to mask a significant portion of greenhouse gas warming 5. The magnitude of the forcing caused by aerosol-cloud interactions depends on several poorly modelled aspects of the climate, but is broadly understood to stem from different treatments of aerosols, clouds and radiation 3,6-8. Nevertheless, the fundamental driver is the change in aerosols from the pre-industrial period to the present day, which controls the change in cloud droplet concentrations. It is recognized that quantification of aerosol indirect forcing requires an understanding of both the pre-industrial aerosol state 9-12 and the effect of the substantial anthropogenic perturbation. However, because of the complexity of processes that determine cloud-forming aerosol concentrations 10 and the computational expense of global aerosol models which explicitly simulate their production and loss processes 13-16 , a comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and leading causes of uncertainty in indirect forcing has not been attempted. Perturbed parameter simulations Here we carry out a variance-based sensitivity analysis of a global aerosol model to attribute the uncertainty in the aerosol first indirect forcing to uncertainties in the emissions and processes that control changes in aerosol over the industrial period. We perform an ensemble of perturbed parameter global aerosol microphysical model simulations using present-day ({PD}) and pre-industrial ({PI}) emissions ({PD} is defined as the year 2000 and {PI} is defined 17 as 1750, with additional {PI} simulations to test the effect of using alternative reference years of 1850 or 1900). The 168 1-year model simulations in the {PI} and {PD} periods cover the full expert-elicited uncertainty space of 28 parameters describing natural and anthropogenic aerosol emissions, aerosol precursor gas emissions, microphysical processes and structures of the aerosol model (see Methods). To characterize fully the magnitude and causes of model uncertainty we use Bayesian emulators conditioned on the ensemble data to generate continuous model output across the parameter space 18,19. This approach enables a Monte Carlo sampling of the model uncertainty space 20 so that a full variance-based sensitivity analysis of the model outputs can be performed. Radiative forcing uncertainty Figure 1 shows the annual mean first indirect radiative forcing and the associated 1s uncertainty when assuming the 1750 reference state. The global annual mean indirect forcing is 21.16 W m 22 (s 5 0.22 W m 22 , 95\% confidence interval 20.7 W m 22 to 21.6 W m 22), compared to the multi-model range reported in ref. 2 of 20.4 W m 22 to 21.8 W m 22 (best estimate, 20.7 W m 22) and an estimate (20.6 6 0.4 W m 22) based on assimilated {PD} aerosol optical depth 21. Our estimated 95\% confidence interval is slightly narrower than the multi-model ensemble range, most probably because the latter includes structural differences in the host model aerosol, cloud and radiation schemes 2,3,6. Nevertheless, improved understanding of the aerosol processes and emissions would clearly help to reduce uncertainty in model forcing calculations. The seasonal variation of global mean forcing and the contributions of different parameters to the uncertainty are shown in Fig. 2a and b (see the Methods and Extended Data Table 3 for the definition and elicited range of each parameter). The eight most important parameters account for 92\% of the forcing variance: volcanic {SO} 2 emissions, anthropogenic {SO} 2 emissions, dimethyl sulphide ({DMS}) emissions from marine biota, the width of the accumulation mode, dry deposition of accumulation mode aerosol, sub-grid sulphate particle formation, the width of the Aitken mode, and the diameter of emitted fossil fuel combustion particles.

	abstract = {Fires are a global phenomenon that impact climate and biogeochemical cycles, and interact with the bio-sphere, atmosphere and cryosphere. These impacts occur on a range of temporal and spatial scales and are difficult to quantify globally based solely on observations. Here we assess the role of fires in the climate system using model estimates of radiative forcing ({RF}) from global fires in pre-industrial, present day, and future time periods. Fire emissions of trace gases and aerosols are derived from Community Land Model simulations and then used in a series of Community Atmosphere Model simulations with representative emissions from the years 1850, 2000, and 2100. Additional simulations are carried out with fire emissions from the Global Fire Emission Database for a present-day comparison. These results are compared against the results of simulations with no fire emissions to compute the contribution from fires. We consider the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol effects (including aerosol effects on biogeochemical cycles), and land and snow surface albedo. Overall, we estimate that pre-industrial fires were responsible for a {RF} of −1 W m −2 with respect to a pre-industrial climate without fires. The largest magnitude pre-industrial forcing from fires was the indirect aerosol effect on clouds (−1.6 W m −2). This was balanced in part by an increase in carbon dioxide concentrations due to fires (+0.83 W m −2). The {RF} of fires increases by 0.5 W m −2 from 1850 to 2000 and 0.2 W m −2 from 1850 to 2100 in the model representation from a combination of changes in fire activity and changes in the background environment in which fires occur , especially increases and decreases in the anthropogenic aerosol burden. Thus, fires play an important role in both the natural equilibrium climate and the climate perturbed by an-thropogenic activity and need to be considered in future climate projections.},

	abstract = {Pressure on land resources is expected to increase as global population continues to climb and the world becomes more affluent, swelling the demand for food. Changing climate may exert additional pressures on natural lands as present-day productive regions may shift, or soil quality may degrade, and the recent rise in demand for biofuels increases competition with edible crops for arable land. Given these projected trends there is a need to understand the global climate impacts of land use and land cover change ({LULCC}). Here we quantify the climate impacts of global {LULCC} in terms of modifications to the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere (radiative forcing, {RF}) that are caused by changes in long-lived and short-lived greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol effects, and land surface albedo. We attribute historical changes in terrestrial carbon storage, global fire emissions, secondary organic aerosol emissions, and surface albedo to {LULCC} using simulations with the Community Land Model version 3.5. These {LULCC} emissions are combined with estimates of agricultural emissions of important trace gases and mineral dust in two sets of Community Atmosphere Model simulations to calculate the {RF} of changes in atmospheric chemistry and aerosol concentrations attributed to {LULCC}. With all forcing agents considered together, we show that 40 \% (±16 \%) of the present-day anthropogenic {RF} can be attributed to {LULCC}. Changes in the emission of non-{CO} 2 greenhouse gases and aerosols from {LULCC} enhance the total {LULCC} {RF} by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to the {LULCC} {RF} from {CO} 2 alone. This enhancement factor also applies to projected {LULCC} {RF}, which we compute for four future scenarios associated with the Representative Concentration Pathways. We attribute total {RFs} between 0.9 and 1.9 W m −2 to {LULCC} for the year 2100 (relative to a prein-dustrial state). To place an upper bound on the potential of {LULCC} to alter the global radiation budget, we include a fifth scenario in which all arable land is cultivated by 2100. This theoretical extreme case leads to a {LULCC} {RF} of 3.9 W m −2 (±0.9 W m −2), suggesting that not only energy policy but also land policy is necessary to minimize future increases in {RF} and associated climate changes.},

Pre-industrial fire-history records from black carbon, charcoal and other proxies provide baseline estimates of biomass burning at local to global scales spanning millennia, and are thus useful to examine the role of fire in the carbon cycle and climate system. Here we use the specific biomarker levo-glucosan together with black carbon and ammonium concentrations from the North Greenland Eemian ({NEEM}) ice cores (77.49 • N, 51.2 • W; 2480 m a.s.l) over the past 2000 years to infer changes in boreal fire activity. Increases in boreal fire activity over the periods 1000-1300 {CE} and decreases during 700-900 {CE} coincide with high-latitude {NH} temperature changes. Levoglucosan concentrations in the {NEEM} ice cores peak between 1500 and 1700 {CE}, and most levo-glucosan spikes coincide with the most extensive central and northern Asian droughts of the past millennium. Many of these multi-annual droughts are caused by Asian monsoon failures, thus suggesting a connection between low-and high-latitude climate processes. North America is a primary source of biomass burning aerosols due to its relative proximity to the Greenland Ice Cap. During major fire events, however, isotopic analyses of dust, back trajectories and links with levoglucosan peaks and regional drought reconstructions suggest that Siberia is also an important source of py-rogenic aerosols to Greenland.},

	abstract = {Landscape fires during the 21st century are expected to change in response to multiple agents of global change. Important controlling factors include climate controls on the length and intensity of the fire season, fuel availability, and fire management, which are already anthro-pogenically perturbed today and are predicted to change further in the future. An improved understanding of future fires will contribute to an improved ability to project future an-thropogenic climate change, as changes in fire activity will in turn impact climate. In the present study we used a coupled-carbon-fire model to investigate how changes in climate, demography, and land use may alter fire emissions. We used climate projections following the {SRES} A1B scenario from two different climate models ({ECHAM}5/{MPI}-{OM} and {CCSM}) and changes in population. Land use and harvest rates were prescribed according to the {RCP} 45 scenario. In response to the combined effect of all these drivers, our model estimated, depending on our choice of climate projection, an increase in future (2075-2099) fire carbon emissions by 17 and 62 \% compared to present day (1985-2009). The largest increase in fire emissions was predicted for Southern Hemisphere South Amer-ica for both climate projections. For Northern Hemisphere Africa, a region that contributed significantly to the global total fire carbon emissions, the response varied between a decrease and an increase depending on the climate projection. We disentangled the contribution of the single forcing factors to the overall response by conducting an additional set of simulations in which each factor was individually held constant at pre-industrial levels. The two different projections of future climate change evaluated in this study led to increases in global fire carbon emissions by 22 \% ({CCSM}) and 66 \% ({ECHAM}5/{MPI}-{OM}). The {RCP} 45 projection of harvest and land use led to a decrease in fire carbon emissions by −5 \%. The {RCP} 26 and {RCP} 60 harvest and landuse projections caused decreases around −20 \%. Changes in human ignition led to an increase of 20 \%. When we also included changes in fire management efforts to suppress fires in densely populated areas, global fire carbon emission decreased by −6 \% in response to changes in population density. We concluded from this study that changes in fire emissions in the future are controlled by multiple interacting factors. Although changes in climate led to an increase in future fire emissions this could be globally counterbalanced by coupled changes in land use, harvest, and demography.},

Here we assessed the parametrization of fires in the Community Land Model ({CLM}-{CN}) and improved the ability of the model to reproduce contemporary global patterns of burned areas and fire emissions. In addition to wildfires we extended {CLM}-{CN} to account for fires related to deforestation. We compared contemporary fire carbon emissions predicted by the model to satellite-based estimates in terms of magnitude and spatial extent as well as interannual and seasonal variability. Long-term trends during the 20th century were compared with historical estimates. Overall we found the best agreement between simulation and observations for the fire parametrization based on the work by Arora and Boer (2005). We obtained substantial improvement when we explicitly considered human caused ignition and fire suppression as a function of population density. Simulated fire carbon emissions ranged between 2.0 and 2.4 Pg C/year for the period 1997-2004. Regionally the simulations had a low bias over Africa and a high bias over South America when compared to satellite-based products. The net terrestrial carbon source due to land use change for the 1990s was 1.2 Pg C/year with 11\% stemming from deforestation fires. During 2000-2004 this flux decreased to 0.85 Pg C/year with a similar relative contribution from deforestation fires. Between 1900 and 1960 we predicted a slight downward trend in global Correspondence to: S. Kloster (silvia.kloster@zmaw.de) fire emissions caused by reduced fuels as a consequence of wood harvesting and also by increases in fire suppression.

	abstract = {Fire emissions are a critical component of carbon and nutrient cycles and strongly affect climate and air quality. Dynamic global vegetation models ({DGVMs}) with interactive fire modeling provide important estimates for long-term and large-scale changes in fire emissions. Here we present the first multi-model estimates of global gridded historical fire emissions for 1700-2012, including carbon and 33 species of trace gases and aerosols. The dataset is based on simulations of nine {DGVMs} with different state-of-the-art global fire models that participated in the Fire Model-ing Intercomparison Project ({FireMIP}), using the same and standardized protocols and forcing data, and the most up-to-date fire emission factor table based on field and laboratory studies in various land cover types. We evaluate the simulations of present-day fire emissions by comparing them with satellite-based products. The evaluation results show that most {DGVMs} simulate present-day global fire emission totals within the range of satellite-based products. They can capture the high emissions over the tropical savannas and low emissions over the arid and sparsely vegetated regions, and the main features of seasonality. However, most models fail to simulate the interannual variability, partly due to a lack of modeling peat fires and tropical deforestation fires. Before the 1850s, all models show only a weak trend in global fire emissions, which is consistent with the multi-source merged historical reconstructions used as input data for {CMIP}6. On the other hand, the trends are quite different among {DGVMs} for the 20th century, with some models showing an increase and others a decrease in fire emissions, mainly as a result of the discrepancy in their simulated responses to human population density change and land use and land cover change ({LULCC}). Our study provides an important dataset for further development of regional and global multi-source merged historical reconstructions, analyses of the historical changes in fire emissions and their uncertainties, and quantification of the role of fire emissions in the Earth system. It also highlights the importance of accurately modeling the responses of fire emissions to {LULCC} and population density change in reducing uncertainties in historical reconstructions of fire emissions and providing more reliable future projections.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable and arguable lines of evidence, including modelling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol-driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed-phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68\% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of -1.60 to -0.65 W m-2, or -2.0 to -0.4 W m-2 with a 90\% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted towards more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial-era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.},

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of {CESM}2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. {CESM}2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, {CESM}1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to {CESM}1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Niño-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. {CESM}2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in {CESM}1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, {CESM}2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of {CESM}1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent {CESM}2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

Given the perceived limitations of top-down, centralized management of natural resources, calls for the devolution of authority for local resources to local communities have increasingly been expressed. Proponents of community-based resource management argue that, situating decision-making closer to the place of resource use and subjecting decision-makers to the repercussions of their decisions creates the potential for more flexible and prudent resource management. Further, by empowering communities to develop their own strategies for local economic development, greater community stability may be achieved. However, neither of these potentials will be realized if the credibility and capacity of communities are assumed rather than interrogated. These hypothesized contingent conditions of effective community-based resource management are described and illustrated based on two examples in western Canada in which communities have been empowered to determine the use of local resources: the siting of a hazardous-waste treatment facility near the town of Swan Hills, Alberta; and the development of the Community Forest Pilot Project in British Columbia. These examples raise a series of concerns and questions that suggest a need for further, in-depth investigation. Ultimately, by identifying barriers to effective community-based resource management, a more refined model of this potentially innovative approach can be fostered. © / Canadian Association of Geographers.},

	abstract = {Black carbon ({BC}) and mineral dust aerosols were analyzed in an ice core from the Colle Gnifetti glacier (Monte Rosa, Swiss-Italian Alps, 45°55′N, 7°52′E, 4455 m above sea level) using chemical and optical methods. The resulting time series obtained from this summer ice record indicate that {BC} transport was primarily constrained by regional anthropogenic activities, i.e., biomass and fossil fuel combustion. More precisely, the δ$^{\textrm{13}}$C composition of {BC} suggests that wood combustion was the main source of preindustrial atmospheric {BC} emissions (C3:C4 ratio of burnt biomass of 75:25). Despite relatively high {BC} emissions prior to 1570, biomass burning activity and especially C4 grassland burning abruptly dropped between 1570 and 1750 (C3:C4 ratio of burnt biomass of 90:10), suggesting that agricultural practices strongly decreased in Europe during this cold period of the "Little Ice Age" ({LIA}). On the other hand, optical analysis revealed that the main source for atmospheric dust transport to the southern parts of the Alps during summer months was driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation control on the dust export from the northern Saharan desert. This southern aerosol source was probably associated with global-scale hydrologic changes, at least partially forced by variability in solar irradiance. In fact, periods of enhanced Saharan dust deposition in the ice core (around 1200-1300, 1430-1520, 1570-1690, 1780-1800, and after 1870) likely reflect drier winters in North Africa, stronger North Atlantic southwesterlies, and increased spring/summer precipitation in west-central Europe. These results, therefore, suggest that the climatic pejorations and the resulting socioeconomic crises, which occurred in Europe during periods of the {LIA}, could have been indirectly triggered by large-scale meridional advection of air masses and wetter summer climatic conditions.

	abstract = {Since the publication of the compilation of biomass burning emission factors by Andreae and Mer-let (2001), a large number of studies have greatly expanded the amount of available data on emissions from various types of biomass burning. Using essentially the same methodology as Andreae and Merlet (2001), this paper presents an updated compilation of emission factors. The data from over 370 published studies were critically evaluated and integrated into a consistent format. Several new categories of biomass burning were added, and the number of species for which emission data are presented was increased from 93 to 121. Where field data are still insufficient, estimates based on appropriate extrapolation techniques are proposed. For key species, the updated emission factors are compared with previously published values. Based on these emission factors and published global activity estimates, I have derived estimates of pyro-genic emissions for important species released by the various types of biomass burning.},

	abstract = {An overview of the Community Earth System Model Version 2 ({CESM}2) is provided, including a discussion of the challenges encountered during its development and how they were addressed. In addition, an evaluation of a pair of {CESM}2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. {CESM}2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, {CESM}1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to {CESM}1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Niño-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. {CESM}2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in {CESM}1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, {CESM}2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of {CESM}1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent {CESM}2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

	abstract = {This study argues that the environmental Kuznets curve ({EKC}) can be shaped as a logistic curve rather than a mere quadratic equation. Instead of being modelled as a polynomial of degree two, the {EKC} can be characterized by a polynomial of degree three. The inverted-U shape remains. However, in the proposed specification, what matters, is the rate at which total environmental degradation ({TED}) occurs, that is, marginal environmental degradation ({MED}). When {TED} is quadratic, {MED} is linearly represented with respect to per capita output. This is considered to be inconsistent with real-life situations, and instead a quadratic {MED} is postulated, from which a logistic {EKC} is derived. Prior to a given income threshold, {MED} rises, attains a maximum at the threshold, and falls ultimately beyond it. This formulation of the {EKC} conforms to the probabilistic econometric models usually applied in environmental studies. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

	abstract = {Iron can be a growth-limiting nutrient for phytoplankton, modifying rates of net primary production, nitrogen fixation, and carbon export - highlighting the importance of new iron inputs from the atmosphere. The bioavailable iron fraction depends on the emission source and the dissolution during transport. The impacts of anthropogenic combustion and land use change on emissions from industrial, domestic, shipping, desert, and wildfire sources suggest that Northern Hemisphere soluble iron deposition has likely been enhanced between 2\% and 68\% over the Industrial Era. If policy and climate follow the intermediate Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 trajectory, then results suggest that Southern Ocean ({\textgreater}30°S) soluble iron deposition would be enhanced between 63\% and 95\% by 2100. Marine net primary productivity and carbon export within the open ocean are most sensitive to changes in soluble iron deposition in the Southern Hemisphere; this is predominantly driven by fire rather than dust iron sources. Changes in iron deposition cause large perturbations to the marine nitrogen cycle, up to 70\% increase in denitrification and 15\% increase in nitrogen fixation, but only modestly impacts the carbon cycle and atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations (1–3 ppm). Regionally, primary productivity increases due to increased iron deposition are often compensated by offsetting decreases downstream corresponding to equivalent changes in the rate of phytoplankton macronutrient uptake, particularly in the equatorial Pacific. These effects are weaker in the Southern Ocean, suggesting that changes in iron deposition in this region dominates the global carbon cycle and climate response.},

	abstract = {The climate impact of deforestation depends on the relative strength of several biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects. In addition to affecting the exchange of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and moisture with the atmosphere and surface albedo, vegetation emits biogenic volatile organic compounds ({BVOCs}) that alter the formation of short-lived climate forcers ({SLCFs}), which include aerosol, ozone and methane. Here we show that a scenario of complete global deforestation results in a net positive radiative forcing ({RF}; 0.12 W m-2) from {SLCFs}, with the negative {RF} from decreases in ozone and methane concentrations partially offsetting the positive aerosol {RF}. Combining {RFs} due to {CO}2, surface albedo and {SLCFs} suggests that global deforestation could cause 0.8 K warming after 100 years, with {SLCFs} contributing 8\% of the effect. However, deforestation as projected by the {RCP}8.5 scenario leads to zero net {RF} from {SLCF}, primarily due to nonlinearities in the aerosol indirect effect.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: We assess the current understanding of the state and behaviour of aerosols under pre-industrial conditions and the importance for climate. Recent Findings: Studies show that the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial period calculated by climate models is strongly affected by the abundance and properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere. The low concentration of aerosol particles under relatively pristine conditions means that global mean cloud albedo may have been twice as sensitive to changes in natural aerosol emissions under pre-industrial conditions compared to present-day conditions. Consequently, the discovery of new aerosol formation processes and revisions to aerosol emissions have large effects on simulated historical aerosol radiative forcing. Summary: We review what is known about the microphysical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere and the processes that control them. Aerosol properties were controlled by a combination of natural emissions, modification of the natural emissions by human activities such as land-use change, and anthropogenic emissions from biofuel combustion and early industrial processes. Although aerosol concentrations were lower in the pre-industrial atmosphere than today, model simulations show that relatively high aerosol concentrations could have been maintained over continental regions due to biogenically controlled new particle formation and wildfires. Despite the importance of pre-industrial aerosols for historical climate change, the relevant processes and emissions are given relatively little consideration in climate models, and there have been very few attempts to evaluate them. Consequently, we have very low confidence in the ability of models to simulate the aerosol conditions that form the baseline for historical climate simulations. Nevertheless, it is clear that the 1850s should be regarded as an early industrial reference period, and the aerosol forcing calculated from this period is smaller than the forcing since 1750. Improvements in historical reconstructions of natural and early anthropogenic emissions, exploitation of new Earth system models, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of the controlling processes are key aspects to reducing uncertainties in future.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone concentrations are sensitive to natural emissions of precursor compounds. In contrast to existing assumptions, recent evidence indicates that terrestrial vegetation emissions in the pre-industrial were larger than in the present-day. We use a chemical transport model and a radiative transfer model to show that revised inventories of pre-industrial fire and biogenic emissions lead to an increase in simulated pre-industrial ozone concentrations, decreasing the estimated pre-industrial to present-day tropospheric ozone radiative forcing of up to 34\% (0.38 Wm-2 to 0.25 Wm-2). We find that this change 25 is sensitive to employing biomass burning and biogenic emissions inventories based on matching vegetation patterns, as co-location of emission sources enhances the effect on ozone formation. Our forcing estimates are at the lower end of existing uncertainty range estimates (0.2-0.6 Wm-2), without accounting for other sources of uncertainty. Thus, future work should focus on reassessing the uncertainty range of tropospheric ozone radiative forcing. 30 https://doi.},

We improve upon existing inventories with a more consistent and reproducible methodology applied to all emission species, updated emission factors, and recent estimates through 2014. The data system relies on existing energy consumption data sets and regional and country-specific inventories to produce trends over recent decades. All emission species are consistently estimated using the same activity data over all time periods. Emissions are provided on an annual basis at the level of country and sector and gridded with monthly seasonality. These estimates are comparable to, but generally slightly higher than, existing global inventories. Emissions over the most recent years are more uncertain, particularly in low- and middle-income regions where country-specific emission inventories are less available. Future work will involve refining and updating these emission estimates, estimating emissions' uncertainty, and publication of the system as open-source software.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The location, timing, spatial extent, and frequency of wildfires are changing rapidly in many parts of the world, producing substantial impacts on ecosystems, people, and potentially climate. Paleofire records based on charcoal accumulation in sediments enable modern changes in biomass burning to be considered in their long-term context. Paleofire records also provide insights into the causes and impacts of past wildfires and emissions when analyzed in conjunction with other paleoenvironmental data and with fire models. Here we present new 1000-year and 22 000-year trends and gridded biomass burning reconstructions based on the Global Charcoal Database version 3 ({GCDv}3), which includes 736 charcoal records (57 more than in version 2). The new gridded reconstructions reveal the spatial patterns underlying the temporal trends in the data, allowing insights into likely controls on biomass burning at regional to global scales. In the most recent few decades, biomass burning has sharply increased in both hemispheres but especially in the north, where charcoal fluxes are now higher than at any other time during the past 22 000 years. We also discuss methodological issues relevant to data–model comparisons and identify areas for future research. Spatially gridded versions of the global data set from {GCDv}3 are provided to facilitate comparison with and validation of global fire simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Finally, we suggest that future developments in ice-core science should aim to combine multiple biomarkers with other records (black carbon, charcoal) and models to discern the types of material being burnt (C3 versus C4 plants, angiosperms, gymnosperms, peat fires, etc.) and to improve constraints on source areas of biomass burning.

Prior to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, human land uses reduced the occurrence of widespread fires while simultaneously adding more ignitions resulting in many small-extent fires. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wet/dry oscillations and their effects on fuels dynamics controlled widespread fire occurrence. In the late 19th century, intensive livestock grazing disrupted fuels continuity and fire spread and then active fire suppression maintained the absence of widespread surface fires during most of the 20th century. The abundance and continuity of fuels is the most important controlling variable in fire regimes of these semi-arid forests. Reduction of widespread fires owing to reduction of fuel continuity emerges as a hallmark of extensive human impacts on past forests and fire regimes.},

The associated reduced wildfire emissions from increase in cropland area do not enhance carbon uptake since natural vegetation that is spared burning was deforested anyway. However, reduction in fire {CO}2 emissions due to fire suppression and landscape fragmentation associated with increases in population density is calculated to enhance land carbon uptake by 0.13 Pg C yr-1, or {\textasciitilde}19\% of the global land carbon uptake (0.7 ± 0.6 Pg C yr-1), for the 1960-2009 period. These results identify reduction in global wildfire {CO}2 emissions as yet another mechanism that is currently enhancing carbon uptake over land.},

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0118571},
	abstract = {Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the landlocked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.},

	volume = {3},
	url = {www.nature.com/natureclimatechange},
	doi = {10.1038/NCLIMATE1911},
	abstract = {A warmer climate would increase the risk of floods 1. So far, only a few studies 2,3 have projected changes in floods on a global scale. None of these studies relied on multiple climate models. A few global studies 4,5 have started to estimate the exposure to flooding (population in potential inundation areas) as a proxy of risk, but none of them has estimated it in a warmer future climate. Here we present global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models. A state-of-the-art global river routing model with an inundation scheme 6 was employed to compute river discharge and inundation area. An ensemble of projections under a new high-concentration scenario 7 demonstrates a large increase in flood frequency in Southeast Asia, Peninsular India, eastern Africa and the northern half of the Andes, with small uncertainty in the direction of change. In certain areas of the world, however, flood frequency is projected to decrease. Another larger ensemble of projections under four new concentration scenarios 7 reveals that the global exposure to floods would increase depending on the degree of warming, but interannual variability of the exposure may imply the necessity of adaptation before significant warming. Floods are among the most major climate-related disasters. In the past decade, reported annual losses from floods have reached tens of billions of {US} dollars and thousands of people were killed each year. Losses and the number of casualties could be larger in the future. Thus, an assessment of changes with regard to floods is a public concern. The latest assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) on observed changes and future projections of floods was provided in chapter 3 (ref. 8) of the {IPCC} special report on extremes, often called the {IPCC} {SREX} report 1. A summary on projected flooding in this report stated that, 'Overall there is low confidence in projections of changes in fluvial floods. Confidence is low due to limited evidence and because the causes of regional changes are complex.' The available literature on global-scale assessments is limited in number. Ref. 2 projected future changes, mostly increases, in great floods of 29 major river basins based on monthly river discharge simulated by a single atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ({AOGCM}) and a river routing scheme. On the basis of daily river discharge calculated from another single {AOGCM} and a simple global river routing model, ref. 3 provided a global distribution of flood frequency changes in a warmer future climate. The use of a single {AOGCM}, however, was the source of a limited evidence statement in the summary of {SREX}. At the time of such previous studies, which is coincident with that of the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 9 ({CMIP}3) for the {IPCC} Fourth Assessment Report ({AR}4), global-scale flood projections could not be implemented easily owing to the limitation to compute a global projection of changes in flooding and evaluate its consistency and spread. Daily runoff data of two sets of {AOGCM} simulations were employed in this study: historical simulations (1850-2005) forced by natural (for example, volcanic and solar) and anthropogenic (for example, greenhouse gases and ozone) forcings, and future simulations (2006-2100) forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway ({RCP}) scenarios 7. The {RCP} spans a range of radiative forcing from 2.6 to 8.5 W m −2 and represents various possible climate outcomes 11. A change in flooding between a present (20C) and a future (21C) time period was obtained as a change in the return period (probability) of a river discharge having a particular magnitude. Following previous studies 3,12 , a river discharge corresponding to a 100-year flood in 20C was selected as the particular magnitude. The time series of simulated annual maximum daily river discharge in 20C (1971-2000) and 21C (2071-2100) were fitted respectively to an extreme distribution function; subsequently, the magnitude of river discharge having a 100-year return period in 20C was calculated at each location. Finally, the return period (generally, not equal to 100 years) of the same magnitude river discharge (equal to the 20C 100-year flood discharge) was computed for the time series of 21C river discharge at each location. The details of the above processes are described in the Methods. Note that the river routing model of this study does not consider the effects of the anthropogenic regulation of flood water, such as by reservoir operations, and potentially simulates a higher peak discharge. Hence, our projection provides the potential risk of flooding, irrespective of non-climatic factors such as land-use changes, river improvements or flood mitigation efforts such as the construction of dams. The global distribution of the multi-model median return period of the 20C 100-year flood discharge in 21C is presented in Fig. 1a. In Figs 1 and 2, we show only the results of {RCP}8.5 in which changes are most remarkable. Thus, Figs 1 and 2 present aspects of the most dangerous climate change outcomes for the near-end of this century (the most dangerous among the four representative scenarios for {CMIP}5). The results of three other {RCP} scenarios (Supplementary Fig. S9) show similar spatial distributions, although the magnitude varies depending on the scenario.

	title = {Disasters and displacement in a changing climate Modelling displacement},
	volume = {49},
	url = {www.fmreview.org/climatechange},
	abstract = {Although those seeking a single global prediction will be disappointed, today's models of climate change-and disaster-induced displacement can provide a range of scenarios for specific countries, regions or hotspots. Empirical models of climate change-and disaster-induced displacement and migration are used to predict how people would be likely to migrate in different scenarios. They have been around for decades 1 but the way such models are being used has evolved over time. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre ({IDMC}) and Climate Interactive 2 have developed a system dynamics model which not only simulates the impacts of droughts, floods and climate change on displacement in northern Kenya but also simulates what happens when different measures are implemented to prevent, mitigate or respond to displacement. Before undertaking work on a model, {IDMC} had to decide if an inherently mobile population of pastoralists in the Horn of Africa could become displaced in the first place, coming to the conclusion that pastoralists become displaced by virtue of the loss of their pastoralist livelihood. The next step was to figure out how, when and why pastoralists become displaced. Articulating this causal theory of displacement meant working with other researchers, government officials, {NGOs} and pastoralists themselves. Over a period of months, this disparate group of actors collectively mapped all of the important factors and causal relationships that connect rainfall and displacement outcomes. These include the interactions between the climate and weather systems, pasture productivity, livestock herd dynamics, livestock prices, and pastoralist decision-making and marketing strategies. Once the causal theory was mapped, stakeholders identified potential entry points for addressing drought-related displacement. We tested the behaviour of the pastoralist displacement model against historical behaviour of key indicators, in this case dating back to 1990, to see whether the model was able to reproduce the same outcomes. Since pastoralist displacement itself has not been well recorded-or even recognised-this validation and calibration of the model involved other relevant factors such as livestock market prices, livestock and human population data, and livestock birth and death rates. Finding ample historical data to validate every component of the model was impossible, resulting in an increase in uncertainty. The initial findings of the analysis are both counter-intuitive and encouraging. If droughts become more frequent and severe in the future due to climate change, it will lead to more displacement-but not a large amount more. Secondly, the analysis suggests that the arid and semi-arid lands, particularly in Kenya, could potentially support more livestock and more pastoralists. That said, a greater number of subsistence pastoralists will result in more displaced pastoralists when droughts occur, unless actions are taken to mitigate that risk. Modelling for policymakers The model also allowed policymakers to test preventive measures. The Government of Kenya's National Drought Management Authority ({NDMA}) has used the system dynamics model to test the impacts of different land-use and livestock policies on reducing the risk of drought-induced displacement in the future. {IDMC} and Climate Interactive plan to work together with the {NDMA} to simulate the effectiveness of the different policy options and investments outlined in the country's Ending Drought Emergencies plan. The aim of this collaboration is to use the displacement model to take evidence-based decisions to reduce drought-related displacement in the future.},

In the lower sub-basin, 1.1-1.5 °C increase in temperature and 11-31\% decrease in annual precipitation are likely. A system dynamics model was used to analyze adaptation strategies taking into account feedbacks between water resources development and biophysical and socioeconomic subsystems. Results suggest that infrastructural improvements, rigorous water demand management (e.g., replacing high water demand crops such as rice, corn, and alfalfa), and ecosystem-based regulatory prioritization, complemented by supply augmentation can temporarily alleviate water stress in a basin that is essentially governed by the Limits to Growth archetype.},

Methods: The mouse models with prostate cancer were constructed with {RM}-1 cells. 36 mice C57 were randomly divided into three groups: model group (fed with an equal volume of olive oil once a day, an equal volume of normal saline injection intraperitoneal once a week), paclitaxel (Taxol) group (20 mg·kg -1, intraperitoneal injection once a week), {PPD} group (20 mg·kg-1, ig once a day), continuous administration of 4 weeks. The tumor size was measured once every 3 d, and the morphological changes of tumor were observed, the animals were killed over the fourth weekend. Observation: the general state of animal tumor weight, tumor volume, inhibitory rate, mortality; and the expression of Cyclin D1 gene was detected with {RT}-{PCR} and Western blotting. Results: Compared with model group, the tumor growth of mice in other groups significantly slowed down, and the mice in {PPD} group had bright hair. The mice in model group scrambled and moved slowly with tumor ulceration, erosion and hemorrhage. The tumor volume of the mice in {PPD} group was significantly smaller than that in model group (P{\textless}0.05) 13 d after administration, and it was also significantly smaller than that in Taxol group (P{\textless}0.05) 21 d after administration. Compared with model group, the tumor weight of the mice in {PPD} group was significantly decreased (P{\textless}0.05), but the inhibitory rate was significantly increased (P{\textless}0.05), no death. Compared with Taxol group, the inhibitory rate in {PPD} group was significantly increased (P{\textless}0.05), the mortality was significantly decreased (P{\textless}0.05). The {RT}-{PCR} and Western blotting results showed that Cyclin D1 gene and protein expressions in treatment groups were significantly reduced (P{\textless}0.05) compared with model groups compared with Taxol group, the expression of Cyclin D1 in {PPD} group was significantly decreased (P{\textless}0.05), but there was no significant difference of Cyclin D1 protein expression between {PPD} group and Taxol group (P{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusion: {PPD} can significantly inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells {RM}-1 and its mechanism may be related to the down-regulation of the expression of Cyclin D1.},

We apply each of these methods to the latest available stock data to provide six estimates of five-year bilateral migration flows between 1990 and 2015. To assess the resulting estimates, we correlate estimates of six migration measures from each method with equivalent reported data where possible. Such systematic efforts at validation have largely been neglected thus far. We show that the correlation between the reported data and the estimates varies widely among different migration measures, over space, and over time.

	abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2-4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25-123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3-9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of {US} 12-71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

Our framework requires that we distinguish between historical versus climate driven migration and recognizes how the impacts of climate change can extend beyond the affected area. We apply our framework to simulate how migration, driven by sea level rise, differs from baseline migration patterns. Specifically, we couple a sea level rise model with a data-driven model of human migration and future population projections, creating a generalized joint model of climate driven migration that can be used to simulate population distributions under potential future sea level rise scenarios. The results of our case study suggest that the effects of sea level rise are pervasive, expanding beyond coastal areas via increased migration, and disproportionately affecting some areas of the United States.},

We present a comprehensive analysis of future coastal flood risk ({CFR}) for Europe that separates the impacts of global warming and socioeconomic development. In the absence of further investments in coastal adaptation, the present expected annual damage ({EAD}) of €1.25 billion is projected to increase by two to three orders of magnitude by the end of the century, ranging between 93 and €961 billion. The current expected annual number of people exposed ({EAPE}) to coastal flooding of 102,000 is projected to reach 1.52–3.65 million by the end of the century. Climate change is the main driver of the future rise in coastal flood losses, with the importance of coastward migration, urbanization and rising asset values rapidly declining with time. To keep future coastal flood losses constant relative to the size of the economy, flood defence structures need to be installed or reinforced to withstand increases in {ESLs} that range from 0.5 to 2.5 m.},

With millions of potential future migrants in heavily populated coastal communities, {SLR} scholarship focusing solely on coastal communities characterizes {SLR} as primarily a coastal issue, obscuring the potential impacts in landlocked communities created by {SLR}-induced displacement. Here I address this issue by merging projected populations at risk of {SLR} with migration systems simulations to project future destinations of {SLR} migrants in the United States. I find that unmitigated {SLR} is expected to reshape the {US} population distribution, potentially stressing landlocked areas unprepared to accommodate this wave of coastal migrants - even after accounting for potential adaptation. These results provide the first glimpse of how climate change will reshape future population distributions and establish a new foundation for modelling potential migration destinations from climate stressors in an era of global environmental change.},

Given projected sea-level rise, it is imperative to examine the extent to which farmers in coastal Bangladesh can adapt by diversifying economic activities before resorting to migration within and across borders. Here, to identify patterns in how households adapt to increased sea/freshwater flooding and soil salinity, we analyse nationally representative socioeconomic and migration data against a suite of environmental variables constructed at the sub-district level. Our results show that inundation alone has negligible effects on migration and agricultural production. However, gradual increases in soil salinity correspond to increasing diversification into aquaculture and internal migration of household members. Salinity is also found to have direct effects on internal and international migration even after controlling for income losses, with mobility restricted to certain locations within Bangladesh. Our study suggests that migration is driven, in part, by the adverse consequences of salinity on crop production.},

This paper aims to comprehend the variety of self-mitigations and the patterns of local migrations of communities in the northern part of Semarang City, Indonesia. The delineation of the risk areas for Rob, a local term for inundation and flooding caused by sea water overflow, was accomplished with the application of {GIS}. Interviews with the inhabitants were conducted to investigate the scale and frequency of Rob and the variety of mitigation, adaptation , and responses at the individual, household or community level. Further investigation was done to comprehend the reasons why people moved away from their current residence to their intended locations. The results show that most inhabitants prefer to stay and to adapt rather than to leave, due to social factors such as being comfortable with their community relationships. Those who wanted to move chose diverse locations spread across various areas of the city. Safer places in the hilly areas of southern Semarang and other residences close to their family or relatives were the most preferable. Based on this understanding, local government should encourage people to be more aware of the potential hydro-meteorological hazards threatening their environment .},

We find that a 2100 {SLR} of 0.9 m places a land area projected to house 4.2 million people at risk of inundation, whereas 1.8 m affects 13.1 million people - approximately two times larger than indicated by current populations. These results suggest that the absence of protective measures could lead to {US} population movements of a magnitude similar to the twentieth century Great Migration of southern African-Americans.

	abstract = {Present-day global mean sea level rise is caused by ocean thermal expansion, ice mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets, as well as changes in terrestrial water storage. For that reason, sea level is one of the best indicators of climate change as it integrates the response of several components of the climate system to internal and external forcing factors. Monitoring the global mean sea level allows detecting changes (e.g., in trend or acceleration) in one or more components. Besides, assessing closure of the sea level budget allows us to check whether observed sea level change is indeed explained by the sum of changes affecting each component. If not, this would reflect errors in some of the components or missing contributions not accounted for in the budget. Since the launch of {TOPEX}/Poseidon in 1992, a precise 27-year continuous record of sea level change is available. It has allowed major advances in our understanding of how the Earth is responding to climate change. The last two decades are also marked by the launch of the {GRACE} satellite gravity mission and the development of the Argo network of profiling floats. {GRACE} space gravimetry allows the monitoring of mass redistributions inside the Earth system, in particular land ice mass variations as well as changes in terrestrial water storage and in ocean mass, while Argo floats allow monitoring sea water thermal expansion due to the warming of the oceans. Together, satellite altimetry, space gravity, and Argo measurements provide unprecedented insight into the magnitude, spatial variability, and causes of present-day sea level change. With this observational network, we are now in a position to address many outstanding questions that are Cazenave et al. Global Mean Sea Level and Its Components important to planning for future sea level rise. Here, we detail the network for observing sea level and its components, underscore the importance of these observations, and emphasize the need to maintain current systems, improve their sensors, and supplement the observational network where gaps in our knowledge remain.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1922190117/-/DCSupplemental},
	abstract = {The two dominant drivers of the global mean sea level ({GMSL}) variability at interannual timescales are steric changes due to changes in ocean heat content and barystatic changes due to the exchange of water mass between land and ocean. With Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ({GRACE}) satellites and Argo profiling floats, it has been possible to measure the relative steric and barystatic contributions to {GMSL} since 2004. While efforts to "close the {GMSL} budget" with satellite altimetry and other observing systems have been largely successful with regards to trends, the short time period covered by these records prohibits a full understanding of the drivers of interannual to decadal variability in {GMSL}. One particular area of focus is the link between variations in the El Niño−Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) and {GMSL}. Recent literature disagrees on the relative importance of steric and barystatic contributions to interannual to decadal variability in {GMSL}. Here, we use a multivariate data analysis technique to estimate variability in barystatic and steric contributions to {GMSL} back to 1982. These independent estimates explain most of the observed interannual variability in satellite altimeter-measured {GMSL}. Both processes, which are highly correlated with {ENSO} variations , contribute about equally to observed interannual {GMSL} variability. A theoretical scaling analysis corroborates the observational results. The improved understanding of the origins of in-terannual variability in {GMSL} has important implications for our understanding of long-term trends in sea level, the hydrological cycle, and the planet's radiation imbalance. sea level {\textbar} climate variability {\textbar} global mean sea level {\textbar} satellite altimetry S ince 1992, satellite altimetry has provided continuous and near-global measurements of sea level, leading to the first definitive assessment of changes in global mean sea level ({GMSL}) (1). From the now 27-y record of satellite-measured sea level, it is estimated that {GMSL} is rising at a rate of ∼3 mm/y, and there are indications of an acceleration in this rise during the record (2). Although the long-term trend is a critical indicator of our warming climate, providing an integrated measure of changes across the climate system, the fluctuations that occur about this trend are also informative. The two dominant drivers of the {GMSL} variability at interannual to decadal timescales are steric changes due to changes in ocean heat content and barystatic changes due to the exchange of water mass between land and ocean (3, 4). With Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ({GRACE}) satellites and Argo profiling floats, it has been possible to measure the relative steric and barystatic contributions to {GMSL} since 2004 (5, 6). Subsequent efforts to close the budget of {GMSL} by comparing the combined steric and barystatic contributions to {GMSL} measured by satellite altimeters over the same time period (7-10) have been largely successful, particularly when focusing on trends, but the short time period covered by these records prohibits a full understanding of the drivers of interannual to decadal variability in {GMSL}. Understanding the nature of this shorter-term variability and the associated {GMSL} response can provide important information on the impact of large-scale signals like the El Niño−Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) on the global climate system (11-13), including Earth's energy budget and the global hydrological cycle. The global oceans play a dominant role in Earth's energy budget and hydrological cycle, accounting for over 90\% of the changes in global heat storage, and reflecting variability in the transfer of water to and from land. Closing the {GMSL} budget across timescales is thus essential to closing the global energy and hydrological budgets. Perhaps most importantly from a climate change perspective, shorter-term variability serves to obscure the background trend in the still relatively short modern sea level records that are available (14-16). Improving the understanding and removing the natural fluctuations on shorter timescales could, in turn, improve our ability to detect the background forced or an-thropogenic trend in {GMSL}. In addition, understanding the drivers of the short-term swings that occur about the long-term trend would aid in planning efforts as high-tide flooding at the coast continues to increase (e.g., ref. 17). Despite its importance and likely due to the availability of only short records, recent literature has disagreed on the relative importance of steric and barystatic contributions to interannual variability in {GMSL} (18-23). Here, we attempt to provide a Significance Extended records of global mean steric and barystatic sea level are produced and exhibit strong agreement with satellite altimeter-observed global mean sea level ({GMSL}). The {GMSL} contributions derived from these datasets show that there are correlated steric and barystatic {GMSL} contributions of similar magnitudes. These variations are closely related to the El Niño−Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) and provide observational support for past studies indicating important steric and bary-static {GMSL} contributions associated with {ENSO}. The improved understanding of the origins of interannual variability in {GMSL} established here has important implications for our understanding of long-term trends in sea level, the hydrological cycle , and the planet's radiation imbalance.},

	abstract = {Global sea levels have risen by approximately 0.2 m since 1900 (ref. 1), with projections showing continued changes under anthropogenic warming. However, estimates of future global mean sea-level rise ({SLR}) vary widely; current projections for the year 2100, for example, range from a low of 0.4 m to a high of 2.5 m (refs 2-4), depending on assumptions of future greenhouse gas emissions, thermal expansion, melt of glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and isostatic adjustment as ice sheets disappear 5. These {SLR} projections are likely conservative, and continued improvements in ice-sheet modelling suggest high-end {SLR} predictions are increasingly likely 6,7. With global coastal populations totalling more than 600 million (projected to surpass one billion people this century 8), any level of {SLR} is expected to impact and potentially displace a large population 9,10. As a result, {SLR} is anticipated to be one of the most expensive and irreversible future consequences of global climate change 9,11-13 , costing up to 4.5\% of global gross domestic product 14. The implications of {SLR} on human migration first appeared in the scientific literature during the late 1970s 16 , when there was increased recognition that disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could lead to major disruption in coastal cities 16 , resulting in migration. It is now understood that {SLR} influences human migration in multiple ways. The most apparent influence involves permanent, irreversible inunda-tion of low-elevation areas, which, under {SLR}, renders land uninhabitable and unavailable for livelihoods 10,12,17 , necessitating relocation. However, various other hazards associated with {SLR} will also impact migration patterns and, in fact, will exert their influence considerably sooner than complete inundation. Hazards include saltwater intrusion into groundwater and agricultural soils 18-23 , coastal flooding 24-26 , shifts in sediment regimes 27 , coastal erosion 28,29 and increased inland penetration of tropical storm surges 30-33. These hazards could spur migration by permanently destroying irrigated coastal agriculture and fresh drinking water supplies 34,35 , disrupting vital human systems 36-38 , reducing property values 39,40 and, ultimately, destroying property and infrastructure 41,42. {SLR} also threatens coastal livelihoods such as tourism 43 , coastal aquiculture 44 , fisheries 45 and silviculture 46 , indirectly pressuring migration through adverse impacts on job security. Since the first studies to quantify population displacement due to {SLR} 15 , our fundamental understanding of {SLR} and human migration has rapidly advanced with the development of basic theory on climate-change migration 47-50 , empirical case studies of historical analogues for future {SLR} 51-55 , integrated economic analysis and modelling of {SLR} retreat 56-58 , explicit models of {SLR} migration 50,59-61 , as well as contentious policy discussions on the need for coastal retreat 62-65. In some cases, studies even question if {SLR} will spur widespread migration at all 66,67 , as demonstrated by island residents in the Philippines who would rather adapt in place to {SLR}-related hazards than follow a relocation programme to the mainland 67. Abstract {\textbar} Anthropogenic sea-level rise ({SLR}) is predicted to impact, and, in many cases, displace, a large proportion of the population via inundation and heightened {SLR}-related hazards. With the global coastal population projected to surpass one billion people this century, {SLR} might be among the most costly and permanent future consequences of climate change. In this Review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding knowledge of human mobility and migration responses to {SLR}, providing a coherent roadmap for future {SLR} research and associated policy. While it is often assumed that direct inundation forces a migration, we discuss how mobility responses are instead driven by a diversity of socioeconomic and demographic factors, which, in some cases, do not result in a migration response. We link {SLR} hazards with potential mechanisms of migration and the associated governmental or institutional policies that operate as obstacles or facilitators for that migration. Specific examples from the {USA}, Bangladesh and atoll island nations are used to contextualize these concepts. However, further research is needed on the fundamental mechanisms underlying {SLR} migration, tipping points, thresholds and feedbacks, risk perception and migration to fully understand migration responses to {SLR}.},

New modelling is necessary to examine the implications of global policy decisions that determine future greenhouse gas emissions and local policies around coastal risk that influence where and how we live. C urrent and future sea-level rise and the accompanying increase in sea-level extremes (collectively, sea-level change) present a key challenge to coastal inhabitants and others living in destinations where retreating coastal migrants may settle over coming decades to centuries 1. Although the physical processes that lead to coastal inundation are crucial in triggering migration decisions, the key dimensions of human mobility resulting from sea-level change-the number of displaced people and migrants, the forms of mobility that people use, the timing of migrations, their likely destinations and the socioeconomic condition of their departures and arrivals-are largely dependent on global policy decisions that determine future greenhouse gas emissions, and on local policies around coastal risk that influence where and how we live. The interaction of sea-level change, various forms of human mobility and the intervening influence of policy raises questions whose answers could inform local planners and national decision-makers, as well as the general population facing this challenge. Figure 1 conceptually depicts the possibility space of sea-level change and human migration and the intervening role of policies, which may simultaneously drive a diversity of outcomes that can be explored and tested in models. Unprotected areas in low-elevation flood plains face a knowable probability of sea-level change and associated frequency of flooding, largely a product of extreme high tides and storm surges, similar under all emissions scenarios to the year 2050 (Fig. 1a). As sea-level change progresses, new exposure is likely to drive multiple simultaneous migration dynamics, even as a diversity of policies act as intervening factors (Fig. 1b). By 2100, different emissions scenarios produce diverging sea-level change trajectories, with corresponding coastal risks that will probably trigger adaptation strategies, namely coastal protection, accommodation and/or retreat, which may influence subsequent migration dynamics (Fig. 1c). We need to know which coastal regions migrants will leave as sea level rises, and the destinations towards which migration will increase. What are feasible interventions that sending and receiving jurisdictions can introduce to influence migration, including adaptation measures to protect coastlines and accommodate infrastructure, but also migration incentives such as income credits, housing subsidies and public services in safer environments? How sensitive is migration induced by sea-level change to macro-level factors, such as interest rates, taxes, social services and entry quotas? What are the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of future migrants, how do they differ from today's migrants, and how do migrants' policy demands differ in areas such as public health, education, housing and income? What makes addressing these questions particularly daunting is the lack of a historical analogue for the projected magnitude of sea-level change 1. New modelling can address this issue. Planners in local jurisdictions have long used 'top-down' spatial and economic models of urban growth to estimate the effect of specific regulatory, zoning or economic policies on future populations 2. The more recent development of 'bottom-up' models, such as agent-based models ({ABMs}), now allows researchers to account for factors that affect human behavioural responses, although these are difficult to quantify at scale, such as individuals' aversions to uncertainty or attachment to their birth location 3. Combining top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches may allow a more comprehensive means to examine the response of complex, emergent human dynamics, such as the effect of adaptation interventions on the coast.},

However, the extent to which the pattern of regional sea level rise measured by altimeters is representative of the forced sea level response remains an open question. Internal variability both contributes to regional sea level changes on short time scales and masks the pattern of forced trend and acceleration associated with anthropogenic global warming. Recent studies have demonstrated that the forced trend pattern of regional rise has begun to emerge, although there has been no assessment of a possible associated acceleration. Here, the regional acceleration pattern is estimated from the altimeter sea level record and assessed with regard to the influence of internal variability. While the dominant features in the acceleration pattern can be attributed to internal variability, there is an indication that the forced acceleration pattern may emerge as the record continues to lengthen.},

After accounting for simulation drift, which in the {LE} is sizable, the {DSL} {FR} is found to be complex, both in space and time. Its evolving character is suggested to arise from both the diversity and transient evolution of climate forcing agents and the slow adjustment timescales of the intermediate and deep oceans. Nonetheless, various intervals of spatially coherent change simulated for the recent past and near future are identified, and their characteristics and associated driving mechanisms are identified and discussed. The mid- to late-20th century {DSL} {FR} is characterized by an hemispherically asymmetric pattern of change, with depressed rates of rise in the northern oceans. There is also a dipole of change in the Southern Ocean caused by changes in near-surface zonal winds. Through the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a different pattern of rise emerges with elevated rates in the tropics and depressed rates at high latitudes. Zonal and interbasin variations characterize both intervals and involve the pattern and depth of anomalous ocean heat content storage and spatial contrasts in the expansion coefficient tied mainly to base state temperature, with greater rates of rise in warm regions per unit warming. The relative roles of surface flux and ocean convergence anomalies are examined.},

	abstract = {B. T. (2018) The effect of South American biomass burning aerosol emissions on the regional climate. Abstract. The impact of biomass burning aerosol ({BBA}) on the regional climate in South America is assessed using 30-year simulations with a global atmosphere-only configuration of the Met Office Unified Model. We compare two simulations of high and low emissions of biomass burning aerosol based on realistic interannual variability. The aerosol scheme in the model has hygroscopic growth and optical properties for {BBA} informed by recent observations, including those from the recent South American Biomass Burning Analysis ({SAMBBA}) intensive aircraft observations made during September 2012. We find that the difference in the Septem-ber (peak biomass emissions month) {BBA} optical depth between a simulation with high emissions and a simulation with low emissions corresponds well to the difference in the {BBA} emissions between the two simulations, with a 71.6 \% reduction from high to low emissions for both the {BBA} emissions and the {BB} {AOD} in the region with maximum emissions (de-fined by a box of extent 5-25 • S, 40-70 • W, used for calculating mean values given below). The cloud cover at all altitudes in the region of greatest {BBA} difference is reduced as a result of the semi-direct effect, by heating of the atmosphere by the {BBA} and changes in the atmospheric stability and surface fluxes. Within the {BBA} layer the cloud is reduced by burn-off, while the higher cloud changes appear to be responding to stability changes. The boundary layer is reduced in height and stabilized by increased {BBA}, resulting in reduced deep convection and reduced cloud cover at heights of 9-14 km, above the layer of {BBA}. Despite the decrease in cloud fraction, September downwelling clear-sky and all-sky shortwave radiation at the surface is reduced for higher emissions by 13.77 ± 0.39 W m −2 (clear-sky) and 7.37 ± 2.29 W m −2 (all-sky), whilst the upwelling shortwave radiation at the top of atmosphere is increased in clear sky by 3.32 ± 0.09 W m −2 , but decreased by −1.36 ± 1.67 W m −2 when cloud changes are included. Shortwave heating rates increase in the aerosol layer by 18 \% in the high emissions case. The mean surface temperature is reduced by 0.14 ± 0.24 • C and mean precipitation is reduced by 14.5 \% in the peak biomass region due to both changes in cloud cover and cloud micro-physical properties. If the increase in {BBA} occurs in a particularly dry year, the resulting reduction in precipitation may exacerbate the drought. The position of the South Atlantic high pressure is slightly altered by the presence of increased {BBA}, and the strength of the southward low-level jet to the east of the Andes is increased. There is some evidence that some impacts of increased {BBA} persist through the transition into the monsoon, particularly in precipitation, but the differences are only statistically significant in some small regions in November. This study therefore provides an insight into how variability in deforestation, realized through variability in biomass burning emissions, may contribute to the South American climate, and consequently on the possible impacts of future changes in {BBA} emissions.},

	abstract = {Despite recent improvements in satellite instrument calibration and the algorithms used to determine reflected solar ({SW}) and emitted thermal ({LW}) top-of-atmosphere ({TOA}) radiative fluxes, a sizeable imbalance persists in the average global net radiation at the {TOA} from satellite observations. This imbalance is problematic in applications that use earth radiation budget ({ERB}) data for climate model evaluation, estimate the earth's annual global mean energy budget, and in studies that infer meridional heat transports. This study provides a detailed error analysis of {TOA} fluxes based on the latest generation of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System ({CERES}) gridded monthly mean data products [the monthly {TOA}/surface averages geostationary ({SRBAVG}-{GEO})] and uses an objective constrainment algorithm to adjust {SW} and {LW} {TOA} fluxes within their range of uncertainty to remove the inconsistency between average global net {TOA} flux and heat storage in the earth-atmosphere system. The 5-yr global mean {CERES} net flux from the standard {CERES} product is 6.5 W m-2, much larger than the best estimate of 0.85 W m-2 based on observed ocean heat content data and model simulations. The major sources of uncertainty in the {CERES} estimate are from instrument calibration (4.2 W m-2) and the assumed value for total solar irradiance (1 W m-2). After adjustment, the global mean {CERES} {SW} {TOA} flux is 99.5 W m-2, corresponding to an albedo of 0.293, and the global mean {LW} {TOA} flux is 239.6 W m-2. These values differ markedly from previously published adjusted global means based on the {ERB} Experiment in which the global mean {SW} {TOA} flux is 107 W m-2 and the {LW} {TOA} flux is 234 W m-2. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {A primary component of the observed recent climate change is the radiative forcing from increased concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases ({LLGHGs}). Effective simulation of anthropogenic climate change by general circulation models ({GCMs}) is strongly dependent on the accurate representation of radiative processes associated with water vapor, ozone, and {LLGHGs}. In the context of the increasing application of the Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. ({AER}), radiation models within the {GCM} community, their capability to calculate longwave and shortwave radiative forcing for clear sky scenarios previously examined by the radiative transfer model intercomparison project ({RTMIP}) is presented. Forcing calculations with the {AER} line-by-line ({LBL}) models are very consistent with the {RTMIP} line-by-line results in the longwave and shortwave. The {AER} broadband models, in all but one case, calculate longwave forcings within a range of -0.20 to 0.23 W m$^{\textrm{-2}}$ of {LBL} calculations and shortwave forcings within a range of -0.16 to 0.38 W m$^{\textrm{-2}}$ of {LBL} results. These models also perform well at the surface, which {RTMIP} identified as a level at which {GCM} radiation models have particular difficulty reproducing {LBL} fluxes. Heating profile perturbations calculated by the broadband models generally reproduce high-resolution calculations within a few hundredths K d$^{\textrm{-1}}$ in the troposphere and within 0.15 K d$^{\textrm{-1}}$ in the peak stratospheric heating near 1 {hPa}. In most cases, the {AER} broadband models provide radiative forcing results that are in closer agreement with high-resolution calculations than the {GCM} radiation codes examined by {RTMIP}, which supports the application of the {AER} models to climate change research.

Results indicate very similar performance to other commonly used mesoscale schemes in an offline driver for idealized warm rain cases, better than the previous version of the global model microphysics scheme with diagnostic precipitation. In the mixed phase regime, there is significantly more water and less ice, which may address a common bias seen with the scheme in climate simulations in the Arctic. For steady forcing cases, the scheme has limited sensitivity to time step out to the {\textasciitilde}15-min time steps typical of global models. The scheme is similar to other schemes with moderate sensitivity to vertical resolution. The limited time step sensitivity bodes well for use of the scheme in multiscale models from the mesoscale to the large scale. The scheme is sensitive to idealized perturbations of cloud drop and crystal number. Precipitation decreases and condensate increases with increasing drop number, indicating substantial decreases in precipitation efficiency. The sensitivity is less than with the previous version of the scheme for low drop number concentrations (Nc {\textless} 100 cm -3). Ice condensate increases with ice number, with large decreases in liquid condensate as well for a mixed phase case. As expected with prognostic precipitation, accretion is stronger than with diagnostic precipitation and the accretion to autoconversion ratio increases faster with liquid water path ({LWP}), in better agreement with idealized models and earlier studies than the previous version.},

	abstract = {The Community Earth System Model version 2 ({CESM}2) includes three main atmospheric configurations: the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 ({CAM}6) with simplified chemistry and a simplified organic aerosol ({OA}) scheme, {CAM}6 with comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry representation ({CAM}6-chem), and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 ({WACCM}6). Both, {CAM}6-chem and {WACCM}6 include a more comprehensive secondary organic aerosols ({SOA}) approach using the Volatility Basis Set ({VBS}) scheme and prognostic stratospheric aerosols. This paper describes the different {OA} schemes available in the different atmospheric configurations of {CESM}2 and discusses differences in aerosol burden and resulting climate forcings. Derived {OA} burden and trends differ due to differences in {OA} formation using the different approaches. Regional differences in Aerosol Optical Depth with larger values using the comprehensive approach occur over {SOA} source regions. Stronger increasing {SOA} trends between 1960 and 2015 in {WACCM}6 compared to {CAM}6 are due to increasing biogenic emissions aligned with increasing surface temperatures. Using the comprehensive {SOA} approach further leads to improved comparisons to aircraft observations and {SOA} formation of ≈143 Tg/yr. We further use {WACCM}6 to identify source contributions of {OA} from biogenic, fossil fuel, and biomass burning emissions, to quantify {SOA} amounts and trends from these sources. Increasing {SOA} trends between 1960 and 2015 are the result of increasing biogenic emissions aligned with increasing surface temperatures. Biogenic emissions are at least two thirds of the total {SOA} burden. In addition, {SOA} source contributions from fossil fuel emissions become more important, with largest values over Southeast Asia. The estimated total anthropogenic forcing of {OA} in {WACCM}6 for 1995–2010 conditions is −0.43 W/m2, mostly from the aerosol direct effect.},

	abstract = {The optical properties of an internally mixed aerosol with a lognormal size distribution can be approximated in terms of analytic functions of the wet surface mode radius with coefficients that can be related to the wet refractive index. The wet radius is calculated from the dry radius and relative humidity using either the Köhler theory or the {MOSAIC} thermodynamic model. The hydration state of the aerosol in the hysteresis region between the crystallization and deliquescence relative humidities is diagnosed by comparing the aerosol water from the previous time step with the current water content of the hydrated aerosol. The wet refractive index is estimated from the volume fractions and refractive indices of all components of the aerosol, including water, using volume mixing for soluble components and an effective medium approximation for the insoluble components. The parameterization is evaluated by comparing with Mie solutions for ammonium sulfate, black carbon, and a 50:50 mixture for a wide range in size distributions and relative humidity. Errors are usually less than 20\% and are less then 30\% for all conditions except when absolute values are small. The parameterization is suitable for any aerosol model that uses lognormal size distributions composed of internal mixtures of multiple aerosol components.

The models are extensively validated against tide gauge data and the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on projections estimated in detail. Global “hotspots” where there is projected to be a significant change in episodic flooding by the end of the century are identified and found to be mostly concentrated in north western Europe and Asia. Results show that for the case of, no coastal protection or adaptation, and a mean {RCP}8.5 scenario, there will be an increase of 48\% of the world’s land area, 52\% of the global population and 46\% of global assets at risk of flooding by 2100. A total of 68\% of the global coastal area flooded will be caused by tide and storm events with 32\% due to projected regional sea level rise.},

	abstract = {The influence of the environment and environmental change is largely unrepresented in standard theories of migration, whilst recent debates on climate change and migration focus almost entirely on displacement and perceive migration to be a problem. Drawing on an increasing evidence base that has assessed elements of the influence of the environment on migration, this paper presents a new framework for understanding the effect of environmental change on migration. The framework identifies five families of drivers which affect migration decisions: economic, political, social, demographic and environmental drivers. The environment drives migration through mechanisms characterised as the availability and reliability of ecosystem services and exposure to hazard. Individual migration decisions and flows are affected by these drivers operating in combination, and the effect of the environment is therefore highly dependent on economic, political, social and demographic context. Environmental change has the potential to affect directly the hazardousness of place. Environmental change also affects migration indirectly, in particular through economic drivers, by changing livelihoods for example, and political drivers, through affecting conflicts over resources, for example. The proposed framework, applicable to both international and internal migration, emphasises the role of human agency in migration decisions, in particular the linked role of family and household characteristics on the one hand, and barriers and facilitators to movement on the other in translating drivers into actions. The framework can be used to guide new research, assist with the evaluation of policy options, and provide a context for the development of scenarios representing a range of plausible migration futures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Flood exposure is increasing in coastal cities owing to growing populations and assets, the changing climate, and subsidence. Here we provide a quantification of present and future flood losses in the 136 largest coastal cities. Using a new database of urban protection and different assumptions on adaptation, we account for existing and future flood defences. Average global flood losses in 2005 are estimated to be approximately {US}\$6 billion per year, increasing to {US}\$52 billion by 2050 with projected socio-economic change alone. With climate change and subsidence, present protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses of {US}\$1 trillion or more per year. Even if adaptation investments maintain constant flood probability, subsidence and sea-level rise will increase global flood losses to {US}\$60-63 billion per year in 2050. To maintain present flood risk, adaptation will need to reduce flood probabilities below present values. In this case, the magnitude of losses when floods do occur would increase, often by more than 50\%, making it critical to also prepare for larger disasters than we experience today. The analysis identifies the cities that seem most vulnerable to these trends, that is, where the largest increase in losses can be expected. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSPs}) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The {SSPs} are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The {SSPs} are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the {SSPs} depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of {SSP}-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 {EJ} in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual {CO}2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 {GtCO}2 to more than 120 {GtCO}2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the {SSP} marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the {SSPs} with high mitigation challenges. While the {SSPs} were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the {SSP} scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project ({CMIP}6).},

One of the major uncertainties in {SLR} projections is the potential rapid disintegration of large fractions of the Antarctic ice sheet ({AIS}). Quantifying this uncertainty is essential to support sound risk management of coastal areas, although it is neglected in many erosion impact assessments. Here, we use the island of Sint Maarten as a case study to evaluate the impact of {AIS} uncertainty for future coastal recession. We estimate {SLR}-induced coastal recession using a probabilistic framework and compare and contrast three cases of {AIS} dynamics within the range of plausible futures. Results indicate that projections of coastal recession are sensitive to local morphological factors and assumptions made on how {AIS} dynamics are incorporated into {SLR} projections and that underestimating the potential rapid mass loss from the {AIS} can lead to ill-informed coastal adaptation decisions.},

	abstract = {Assessing potential changes in North Atlantic ({NA}) tropical storm ({TS}) activity this century is of paramount societal and economic significance, and the topic of intense scientific research. We explore projections of {NA} {TS} changes over the twenty-first century by applying a statistical downscaling methodology to a suite of experiments with the latest state-of-the-art global coupled climate models. We also apply a methodology to partition the dominant sources of uncertainty in the {TS} projections. We find that over the first half of the twenty-first century radiative forcing changes act to increase {NA} {TS} frequency; this increase arises from radiative forcings other than increasing {CO} 2 (probably aerosols). However, {NA} {TS} trends over the entire twenty-first century are of ambiguous sign. We find that for {NA} {TS} frequency, in contrast to sea surface temperature ({SST}), the largest uncertainties are driven by the chaotic nature of the climate system and by the climate response to radiative forcing. These results highlight the need to better understand the processes controlling patterns of {SST} change in response to radiative forcing and internal climate variability to constrain estimates of future {NA} {TS} activity. Coordinated experiments isolating forcing agents in projections should improve our understanding, and would enable better assessment of future {TS} activity. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Land-use activities associated with artificial drainage infrastructure (canals, ditches, and drains) could exacerbate saltwater exposure. However, studies assessing the effects of artificial drainage on the vulnerability of coastal landscapes to saltwater exposure are lacking. We examined the extent to which artificial drainage infrastructure has altered the potential for saltwater intrusion in the coastal plain of eastern North Carolina. Regional spatial analyses demonstrate that artificial drainages not only lower the overall elevation in coastal landscapes, but they also alter the routing and concentration of hydrological flows. Together, these factors have the potential to increase the total proportion of the landscape vulnerable to saltwater intrusion, not only in areas adjacent to drainage infrastructure but also in places where no artificial drainages exist due to large scale effects of flow rerouting. Among all land cover types in eastern North Carolina, wetlands are most vulnerable to saltwater exposure. Droughts and coastal storms associated with climate change potentially exacerbate vulnerability to saltwater facilitated by artificial drainage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

At one site (the Socorro volcanic island), a striking correlation is reported between sea level differences and {DORIS} height time series. The observed trend likely reflects a post eruptive deformation associated with a volcanic eruption that occurred in early 1993. At several other gauge sites, the sea level differences present large linear trends possibly bearing evidence of land motion. This may be the case at Rabaul (Papua New Guinea) where a volcanic eruption took place in autumn of 1994.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present an analysis of over 23,000 globally distributed wildfire smoke plume injection heights derived from Multi-angle Imaging {SpectroRadiometer} ({MISR}) space-based, multi-angle stereo imaging. Both pixel-weighted and aerosol optical depth ({AOD})-weighted results are given, stratified by region, biome, and month or season. This offers an observational resource for assessing first-principle plume-rise modelling, and can provide some constraints on smoke dispersion modelling for climate and air quality applications. The main limitation is that the satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit, crossing the equator at about 10:30 a.m. local time on the day side. Overall, plumes occur preferentially during the northern mid-latitude burning season, and the vast majority inject smoke near-surface. However, the heavily forested regions of North and South America, and Africa produce the most frequent elevated plumes and the highest {AOD} values; some smoke is injected to altitudes well above 2 km in nearly all regions and biomes. Planetary boundary layer ({PBL}) versus free troposphere injection is a critical factor affecting smoke dispersion and environmental impact, and is affected by both the smoke injection height and the {PBL} height; an example assessment is made here, but constraining the {PBL} height for this application warrants further work.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and gas are increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. These increased concentrations cause additional energy to be retained in Earth's climate system, thus increasing Earth's temperature. Various methods have been proposed to prevent this temperature increase either by reflecting to space sunlight that would otherwise warm Earth or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Such intentional alteration of planetary-scale processes has been termed geoengineering. The first category of geoengineering method, solar geoengineering (also known as solar radiation management, or {SRM}), raises novel global-scale governance and environmental issues. Some {SRM} approaches are thought to be low in cost, so the scale of {SRM} deployment will likely depend primarily on considerations of risk. The second category of geoengineering method, carbon dioxide removal ({CDR}), raises issues related primarily to scale, cost, effectiveness, and local environmental consequences. The scale of {CDR} deployment will likely depend primarily on cost. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

We find that respondents who expect severe global climate change damages and who have little confidence in current mitigation efforts are more opposed to geoengineering than respondents who are less pessimistic about global damages and mitigation efforts. However, we also find that respondents are more supportive of geoengineering when they expect severe climate change damages in their home country than when they have more optimistic expectations for the home country.

The report finds that, despite a brief dip in carbon dioxide emissions caused by the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the world is still heading for a temperature rise in excess of 3°C this century – far beyond the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing 1.5°C. However, a low-carbon pandemic recovery could cut 25 per cent off the greenhouse emissions expected in 2030, based on policies in place before {COVID}-19. Such a recovery would far outstrip savings foreseen with the implementation of unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, and put the world close to the 2°C pathway. The report also analyses low-carbon recovery measures so far, summarizes the scale of new net-zero emissions pledges by nations and looks at the potential of the lifestyle, aviation and shipping sectors to bridge the gap.

	abstract = {This work documents how the midlatitude, eddy-driven jets respond to climate change using model output from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}5). The authors consider separately the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere jets. The analysis is not limited to annualmean changes in the latitude and speed of the jets, but also explores how the variability of each jet changes with increased greenhouse gases. All jets are found to migrate poleward with climate change: the Southern Hemisphere jet shifts poleward by 2° of latitude between the historical period and the end of the twenty-first century in the representative concentration pathway 8.5 ({RCP}8.5) scenario, whereas both Northern Hemisphere jets shift by only 1°. In addition, the speed of the Southern Hemisphere jet is found to increase markedly (by 1.2ms-1 between 850 and 700 {hPa}), while the speed remains nearly constant for both jets in the Northern Hemisphere. More importantly, it is found that the patterns of jet variability are a strong function of the jet position in all three sectors of the globe, and as the jets shift poleward the patterns of variability change. Specifically, for the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic jets, the variability becomes less of a north-south wobbling and more of a pulsing (i.e., variation in jet speed). In contrast, for the North Pacific jet, the variability becomes less of a pulsing and more of a north-south wobbling. These different responses can be understood in terms of Rossby wave breaking, allowing the authors to explain most of the projected jet changes within a single dynamical framework. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

Recent work by the authors showed that for the models making up the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 ({CMIP}3), this drying was found mainly in the midlatitude-driven precipitation poleward of the model subtropical precipitation minima. Here, using more comprehensive diagnostics, we extend that work to 36 new {CMIP}5 models, and find that {CMIP}5 robust precipitation declines are also found mainly between subtropical minima and midlatitude precipitation maxima, implicating dynamic poleward expansion of dry zones rather than thermodynamic amplification of dry-wet contrasts. We also give the full seasonal cycle of these projected declines, showing that they are much more widespread in local spring than in local fall, and that for most of the year in the Northern Hemisphere they are entirely confined to the Atlantic side of the globe.

	abstract = {The steady-state extratropical atmospheric response to thermal forcing is investigated in a simple atmospheric general circulation model. The thermal forcings qualitatively mimic three key aspects of anthropogenic climate change: warming in the tropical troposphere, cooling in the polar stratosphere, and warming at the polar surface. The principal novel findings are the following: 1) Warming in the tropical troposphere drives two robust responses in the model extratropical circulation: poleward shifts in the extratropical tropospheric storm tracks and a weakened stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation. The former result suggests heating in the tropical troposphere plays a fundamental role in the poleward contraction of the storm tracks found in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC})-class climate change simulations; the latter result is in the opposite sense of the trends in the Brewer-Dobson circulation found in most previous climate change experiments. 2) Cooling in the polar stratosphere also drives a poleward shift in the extratropical storm tracks. The tropospheric response is largely consistent with that found in previous studies, but it is shown to be very sensitive to the level and depth of the forcing. In the stratosphere, the Brewer-Dobson circulation weakens at midlatitudes, but it strengthens at high latitudes because of anomalously poleward heat fluxes on the flank of the polar vortex. 3) Warming at the polar surface drives an equatorward shift of the storm tracks. The storm-track response to polar warming is in the opposite sense of the response to tropical tropospheric heating; hence large warming over the Arctic may act to attenuate the response of the Northern Hemisphere storm track to tropical heating. 4) The signs of the tropospheric and stratospheric responses to all thermal forcings considered here are robust to seasonal changes in the basic state, but the amplitude and details of the responses exhibit noticeable differences between equinoctial and wintertime conditions. Additionally, the responses exhibit marked non-linearity in the sense that the response to multiple thermal forcings applied simultaneously is quantitatively different from the sum of the responses to the same forcings applied independently. Thus the response of the model to a given thermal forcing is demonstrably dependent on the other thermal forcings applied to the model. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation's ({HSRC}) 2012 ocean fertilisation experiment introduced a controversial geoengineering technology to the First Nations village of Old Massett on the islands of Haida Gwaii in British Columbia. Local debate centred on conflicting interpretations of the potential environmental impacts of the project and on the Corporation's attempts to align its public brand with the Haida name and proud identity of environmental stewardship. More broadly, the controversy illustrated long-standing arguments about the desirability and feasibility of ocean fertilisation as a geoengineering response to the threat of anthropogenic climate change. Using the {HSRC} case, this paper reports a novel situated study of public perceptions of geoengineering that combines ethnographic engagement with Q-methodology. Three distinct viewpoints on ocean fertilisation are revealed, shaped by the unique confluence of social, political, cultural and environmental circumstances of Haida Gwaii. These viewpoints on ocean fertilisation reflect different ideas held by local residents about planetary limits, about the way humans attain knowledge of natural systems and about the human values of, and responsibilities toward, nature. Although the revealed viewpoints are constructed through contextually specific local meanings, they engage with debates that emerge across a range of other geoengineering technologies and which reflect contested philosophical positions visible in wider environmental management and restoration discourses. The case of ocean fertilisation off the islands of Haida Gwaii may therefore provide a useful benchmark for reflexivity in geoengineering governance. Our case study shows that engaging with the situated beliefs and values that underpin human attitudes and responses towards novel geoengineering technologies is a sine qua non for good governance. Even so, our results suggest such technologies will likely always be contested given the diverse ways in which people understand human relations with the non-human world.},

For this reason, it is important to understand the response of pelagic biota to increased iron supply. Here we report the results of a mesoscale iron fertilization experiment in the polar Southern Ocean, where the potential to sequester iron-elevated algal carbon is probably greatest. Increased iron supply led to elevated phytoplankton biomass and rates of photosynthesis in surface waters, causing a large drawdown of carbon dioxide and macronutrients, and elevated dimethyl sulphide levels after 13 days. This drawdown was mostly due to the proliferation of diatom stocks. But downward export of biogenic carbon was not increased. Moreover, satellite observations of this massive bloom 30 days later, suggest that a sufficient proportion of the added iron was retained in surface waters. Our findings demonstrate that iron supply controls phytoplankton growth and community composition during summer in these polar Southern Ocean waters, but the fate of algal carbon remains unknown and depends on the interplay between the processes controlling export, remineralisation and timescales of water mass subduction.},

While volcanic eruptions have been suggested as innocuous examples of stratospheric aerosols cooling the planet, the volcano analog actually argues against geoengineering because of ozone depletion and regional hydrologic and temperature responses. To further investigate the climate response, here we simulate the climate response to both tropical and Arctic stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosol precursors using a comprehensive atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies {ModelE}. We inject {SO}2 and the model converts it to sulfate aerosols, transports the aerosols and removes them through dry and wet deposition, and calculates the climate response to the radiative forcing from the aerosols. We conduct simulations of future climate with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B business-as-usual scenario both with and without geoengineering and compare the results. We find that if there were a way to continuously inject {SO}2 into the lower stratosphere, it would produce global cooling. Tropical {SO}2 injection would produce sustained cooling over most of the world, with more cooling over continents. Arctic {SO}2 injection would not just cool the Arctic. Both tropical and Arctic {SO}2 injection would disrupt the Asian and African summer monsoons, reducing precipitation to the food supply for billions of people. These regional climate anomalies are but one of many reasons that argue against the implementation of this kind of geoengineering. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {A new set of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering ({SAG}) model experiments has been performed with Community Earth System Model version 2 ({CESM}2) with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model ({WACCM}6) that are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 ({CMIP}6) overshoot scenario ({SSP}5-34-{OS}) as a baseline scenario to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2.0 ◦C above 1850–1900 con- ditions. The overshoot scenario allows us to applying a peak-shaving scenario that reduces the needed duration and amount of {SAG} application compared to a high forcing scenario. In addition, a feedback algorithm identifies the needed amount of sulfur dioxide injections in the stratosphere at four pre-defined latitudes, 30◦ N, 15◦ N, 15◦ S, and 30◦ S, to reach three surface temperature targets: global mean temperature, and interhemispheric and pole-to-Equator temperature gradients. These targets further help to reduce side effects, including overcooling in the tropics, warming of high latitudes, and large shifts in precipitation patterns. These experiments are therefore relevant for investigating the impacts on society and ecosystems. Comparisons to {SAG} simulations based on a high emission pathway baseline scenario ({SSP}5-85) are also performed to investigate the dependency of impacts using different injection amounts to offset surface warming by {SAG}. We find that changes from present-day conditions around 2020 in some variables depend strongly on the defined temperature target (1.5 ◦C vs. 2.0 ◦C). These include surface air temperature and related impacts, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which impacts ocean net primary productivity, and changes in ice sheet surface mass balance, which impacts sea level rise. Others, including global precipitation changes and the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, de- pend strongly on the amount of {SAG} application. Furthermore, land net primary productivity as well as ocean acidification depend mostly on the global atmospheric {CO}2 concentration and therefore the baseline scenario. Multi-model comparisons of experiments that include strong mitigation and carbon dioxide removal with some {SAG} application are proposed to assess the robustness of impacts on societies and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas, the most important gaseous source of infrared opacity in the atmosphere. As the concentrations of other greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, increase because of human activity, it is centrally important to predict how the water vapor distribution will be affected. To the extent that water vapor concentrations increase in a warmer world, the climatic effects of the other greenhouse gases will be amplified. Models of the Earth's climate indicate that this is an important positive feedback that increases the sensitivity of surface temperatures to carbon dioxide by nearly a factor of two when considered in isolation from other feedbacks, and possibly by as much as a factor of three or more when interactions with other feedbacks are considered. Critics of this consensus have attempted to provide reasons why modeling results are overestimating the strength of this feedback. Our uncertainty concerning climate sensitivity is disturbing. The range most often quoted for the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of {CO}2 concentrations in the atmosphere is 1.5 °C to 4.5 °C. If the Earth lies near the upper bound of this sensitivity range, climate changes in the twenty-first century will be profound. The range in sensitivity is primarily due to differing assumptions about how the Earth's cloud distribution is maintained; all the models on which these estimates are based possess strong water vapor feedback. If this feedback is, in fact, substantially weaker than predicted in current models, sensitivities in the upper half of this range would be much less likely, a conclusion that would clearly have important policy implications. In this review, we describe the background behind the prevailing view on water vapor feedback and some of the arguments raised by its critics, and attempt to explain why these arguments have not modified the consensus within the climate research community.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of global climate with respect to forcing is generally described in terms of the global climate feedback-the global radiative response per degree of global annual mean surface temperature change. While the global climate feedback is often assumed to be constant, its value-diagnosed from global climate models-shows substantial time variation under transient warming. Here a reformulation of the global climate feedback in terms of its contributions from regional climate feedbacks is proposed, providing a clear physical insight into this behavior. Using (i) a state-of-the-art global climate model and (ii) a low-order energy balance model, it is shown that the global climate feedback is fundamentally linked to the geographic pattern of regional climate feedbacks and the geographic pattern of surface warming at any given time. Time variation of the global climate feedback arises naturally when the pattern of surface warming evolves, actuating feedbacks of different strengths in different regions. This result has substantial implications for the ability to constrain future climate changes from observations of past and present climate states. The regional climate feedbacks formulation also reveals fundamental biases in a widely used method for diagnosing climate sensitivity , feedbacks, and radiative forcing-the regression of the global top-of-atmosphere radiation flux on global surface temperature. Further, it suggests a clear mechanism for the ''efficacies'' of both ocean heat uptake and radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Solar radiation management ({SRM}) is a controversial technological proposal to deliberately cool the Earth for addressing climate change. Because of great concerns over global consequences of {SRM} deployment, an inclusive and global conversation is considered necessary for the governance of {SRM}. However, public perception research on {SRM} to date has been mostly limited to the Global North or Western democracy. Because social acceptability is crucial for {SRM} governance, such research must also encompass the Global South or Eastern perspectives beyond the Western bias. The present study conducted an online survey of college students in six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea) about their attitudes toward stratospheric aerosol geoengineering, one of most discussed {SRM} proposals. Our results showed that students from the Global South (China, India, the Philippines) were more willing to accept geoengineering as a potential option than those from the Global North (Australia, Japan, and South Korea). We also found an overwhelming consensus in support of geoengineering governance principles such as information disclosure and pre-deployment regulation across all six countries. Our results suggest that more nuanced and granular understandings of non-Western perspectives are critical to enable inclusive democratic debate on geoengineering governance.},

We trace how specific understandings of equity figure centrally—although not always explicitly—in these expert visions. We find that understandings of equity in such “vanguard visions” are narrowly conceived as epistemic challenges, answerable by (more) scientific analysis. Major concerns about equity are treated as empirical matters, requiring scientific assessment of feasibility, risks, or “win–win” distributive outcomes and optimizations, with concurrent calls to delimit risk or reduce scientific uncertainties. We argue that such epistemic framings sidestep, inter alia, the inequality in resources available to diverse non-experts—including the “vulner-able” evoked in expert visions—to project their own equity perspectives onto imagined technological pathways of the future. These may include concerns relating to moral or historical responsibility and/or lack of agency in shaping the directions of innovation.

	abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds cover 20\% of the low-latitude oceans and are especially prevalent in the subtropics. They cool the Earth by shading large portions of its surface from sunlight. However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when {CO} 2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm. In addition to the warming from rising {CO} 2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8 K globally and 10 K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once {CO} 2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if {CO} 2 levels continue to rise.},

This paper investigates relationships between disaster-level fire events and extreme heat on county-level migration in the {USA} using annual panel data for the years 1990–2015. Are wildfire and extreme heat associated with changes in migration patterns? And, are relationships between such “disamenities” and migration stronger in counties with closer ties to environmental amenities? Fixed effects and random effects regression analysis show that both experiencing a disaster-level wildfire and extreme heat in the prior year were associated with reduced migration. Relationships are stronger in counties rich in natural amenities and outdoor recreation, suggesting that in places known for their environmental amenities, shifts toward environmental disamenities may be particularly impactful.},

	abstract = {Climate, land use, and other anthropogenic and natural drivers have the potential to influence fire dynamics in many regions. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the changing role of these drivers and their impact on atmospheric composition, long-term fire records are needed that fuse information from different satellite and in situ data streams. Here we describe the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database ({GFED}) and quantify global fire emissions patterns during 1997-2016. The modeling system, based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach ({CASA}) biogeochemical model, has several modifications from the previous version and uses higher quality input datasets. Significant upgrades include (1) new burned area estimates with contributions from small fires, (2) a revised fuel consumption parameterization optimized using field observations, (3) modifications that improve the representation of fuel consumption in frequently burning landscapes, and (4) fire severity estimates that better represent continental differences in burning processes across boreal regions of North America and Eurasia. The new version has a higher spatial resolution (0.25) and uses a different set of emission factors that separately resolves trace gas and aerosol emissions from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Global mean carbon emissions using the burned area dataset with small fires ({GFED}4s) were 2.21015 grams of carbon per year (Pg Cyr-1) during 1997-2016, with a maximum in 1997 (3.0 Pg C yr-1) and minimum in 2013 (1.8 Pg C yr-1). These estimates were 11\% higher than our previous estimates ({GFED}3) during 1997-2011, when the two datasets overlapped. This net increase was the result of a substantial increase in burned area (37 \%), mostly due to the inclusion of small fires, and a modest decrease in mean fuel consumption (-19 \%) to better match estimates from field studies, primarily in savannas and grasslands. For trace gas and aerosol emissions, differences between {GFED}4s and {GFED}3 were often larger due to the use of revised emission factors. If small fire burned area was excluded ({GFED}4 without the "s" for small fires), average emissions were 1.5 Pg C yr-1. The addition of small fires had the largest impact on emissions in temperate North America, Central America, Europe, and temperate Asia. This small fire layer carries substantial uncertainties; improving these estimates will require use of new burned area products derived from high-resolution satellite imagery. Our revised dataset provides an internally consistent set of burned area and emissions that may contribute to a better understanding of multi-decadal changes in fire dynamics and their impact on the Earth system. {GFED} data are available from http://www.globalfiredata.org.},

Australian governments are currently funding feasibility testing of three geoengineering proposals for the {GBR}. Each proposal involves manipulating ocean or atmospheric conditions to lower water temperatures and thereby reduce the threat of mass coral bleaching events. Innovative strategies to protect the {GBR} and field testing of these is essential, but current laws do not guarantee robust governance for field testing of these technologies. Nor do they provide the foundation for a more coherent national policy on climate intervention technologies more generally. Responsible governance frameworks, including detailed risk assessment and early public consultation, are necessary for geoengineering research to build legitimacy and promote scientific progress. Key policy insights Marine heatwaves pose a serious threat to coral reefs, including Australia’s iconic Great Barrier Reef. Australian governments have recognized the threats of warming waters, and are funding research of geoengineering options for the Great Barrier Reef. The limited earlier field testing of geoengineering demonstrates the need for specific governance to manage risks, build legitimacy and maintain public support.

This would produce a cooling, which general circulation model ({GCM}) computations suggest could-subject to satisfactory resolution of technical and scientific problems identified herein-have the capacity to balance global warming up to the carbon dioxide-doubling point. We describe herein an account of our recent research on a number of critical issues associated with {MCB}. This involves (i) {GCM} studies, which are our primary tools for evaluating globally the effectiveness of {MCB}, and assessing its climate impacts on rainfall amounts and distribution, and also polar sea-ice cover and thickness; (ii) high-resolution modelling of the effects of seeding on marine stratocumulus, which are required to understand the complex array of interacting processes involved in cloud brightening; (iii) microphysical modelling sensitivity studies, examining the influence of seeding amount, seedparticle salt-mass, air-mass characteristics, updraught speed and other parameters on cloud-albedo change; (iv) sea water spray-production techniques; (v) computational fluid dynamics studies of possible large-scale periodicities in Flettner rotors; and (vi) the planning of a three-stage limited-area field research experiment, with the primary objectives of technology testing and determining to what extent, if any, cloud albedo might be enhanced by seeding marine stratocumulus clouds on a spatial scale ofaround 100 × 100 km.

Results show that the effectiveness of cloud brightening depends strongly on meteorological and background aerosol conditions. Cloud albedo enhancement is very effective in a weakly precipitating boundary layer and in {CCN}-limited conditions preceded by heavy and/or persistent precipitation. The additional {CCN} help sustain cloud water by weakening the precipitation substantially in the former case and preventing the boundary layer from collapse in the latter. For a given amount of injected {CCN}, the injection method (i.e., number and distribution of sprayers) is critical to the spatial distribution of these {CCN}. Both the areal coverage and the number concentration of injected particles are key players but neither one always emerges as more important than the other. The same amount of injected material is much less effective in either strongly precipitating clouds or polluted clouds, and it is ineffective in a relatively dry boundary layer that supports clouds of low liquid water path. In the polluted case and "dry" case, the {CCN} injection increases drop number concentration but lowers supersaturation and liquid water path. As a result, the cloud experiences very weak albedo enhancement, regardless of the injection method. © 2011 Author(s).},

The nine contributing models prescribe a 50g\% increase in the cloud droplet number concentration ({CDNC}) of low clouds over the global oceans in an experiment dubbed G4cdnc, with the purpose of counteracting the radiative forcing due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases under the {RCP}4.5 scenario. The model ensemble median effective radiative forcing ({ERF}) amounts to g'1.9gWgmg'2, with a substantial inter-model spread of g'0.6 to g'2.5gWgmg'2. The large spread is partly related to the considerable differences in clouds and their representation between the models, with an underestimation of low clouds in several of the models. All models predict a statistically significant temperature decrease with a median of (for years 2020-2069) g'0.96 [g'0.17 to g'1.21]{gK} relative to the {RCP}4.5 scenario, with particularly strong cooling over low-latitude continents. Globally averaged there is a weak but significant precipitation decrease of g'2.35 [g'0.57 to g'2.96]g\% due to a colder climate, but at low latitudes there is a 1.19g\% increase over land. This increase is part of a circulation change where a strong negative top-of-atmosphere ({TOA}) shortwave forcing over subtropical oceans, caused by increased albedo associated with the increasing {CDNC}, is compensated for by rising motion and positive {TOA} longwave signals over adjacent land regions.},

The effective radiative forcing induced by {SAI} is significantly stronger than its instantaneous counterpart evaluated at the top of atmosphere. Radiative kernel calculations indicate that this occurs because of a significant stratospheric warming and despite a large increase in stratospheric water vapor that strengthens the greenhouse effect. There is also a large decrease in high-level cloudiness induced by a stratification of the upper tropopause. Our model experiments also show that the radiative effects of {SAI} and {MCB} are quasi-additive and have fairly complementary patterns in the Tropics.

Broadly speaking, warming increases atmospheric moisture holding capacity, intensifies moisture transports and makes sub-tropical dry regions drier and tropical and mid-to-high-latitude wet regions wetter. Extra-tropical precipitation patterns vary strongly with longitude, however, owing to the control exerted by the storm tracks and quasi-stationary highs and lows or stationary waves. Regional precipitation change will, therefore, also depend on how these aspects of the circulation respond. Current climate models robustly predict a change in the Northern Hemisphere ({NH}) winter stationary wave field that brings wetting southerlies to the west coast of North America, and drying northerlies to interior southwest North America and the eastern Mediterranean. Here we show that this change in the meridional wind field is caused by strengthened zonal mean westerlies in the sub-tropical upper troposphere, which alters the character of intermediate-scale stationary waves. Thus, a robust and easily understood model response to global warming is the prime cause of these regional wind changes. However, the majority of models probably overestimate the magnitude of this response because of biases in their climatological representation of the relevant waves, suggesting that winter season wetting of the North American west coast will be notably less than projected by the multi-model mean.},

	abstract = {Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}5) robustly predict that the rate of increase in global-mean precipitation with global-mean surface temperature increase is much less than the rate of increase of water vapor. The goal of this paper is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which precipitation increase is constrained by radiative cooling. Changes in clear-sky atmospheric radiative cooling resulting from changes in temperature and humidity in global warming simulations are in good agreement with the multimodel, global-mean precipitation increase projected by {GCMs} ({\textasciitilde}1.1Wm-2K-1). In an atmosphere with fixed specific humidity, radiative cooling from the top of the atmosphere ({TOA}) increases in response to a uniform temperature increase of the surface and atmosphere, while atmospheric cooling by exchange with the surface decreases because the upward emission of longwave radiation from the surface increases more than the downward longwave radiation from the atmosphere. When a fixed relative humidity ({RH}) assumption is made, however, uniform warming causes a much smaller increase of cooling at the {TOA}, and the surface contribution reverses to an increase in net cooling rate due to increased downward emission from water vapor. Sensitivity of precipitation changes to lapse rate changes is modest when {RH} is fixed. Carbon dioxide reduces {TOA} emission with only weak effects on surface fluxes, and thus suppresses precipitation. The net atmospheric cooling response and thereby the precipitation response to {CO}2-induced warming at fixed {RH} are mostly contributed by changes in surface fluxes. The role of clouds is discussed. Intermodel spread in the rate of precipitation increase across the {CMIP}5 simulations is attributed to differences in the atmospheric cooling. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

Several physical contributions govern the response of precipitation extremes. The thermodynamic contribution is robust and well understood, but theoretical understanding of the microphysical and dynamical contributions is still being developed. Orographic precipitation extremes and snowfall extremes respond differently from other precipitation extremes and require particular attention.

The spatio-temporal links between sea, surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air- sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12\% of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean - and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia - brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

We have tested this hypothesis in a global climate model with a state-of-the-art representation of cirrus clouds and find that cirrus cloud seeding has the potential to cancel the entire warming caused by human activity from pre-industrial times to present day. However, the desired effect is only obtained for seeding particle concentrations that lie within an optimal range. With lower than optimal particle concentrations, a seeding exercise would have no effect. Moreover, a higher than optimal concentration results in an over-seeding that could have the deleterious effect of prolonging cirrus lifetime and contributing to global warming. © 2013.

Modeling studies have shown that there are trade-offs between changes in temperature and hydrological cycle in response to solar geoengineering. Here we investigate the possibility of stabilizing both global mean temperature and precipitation simultaneously by combining two geoengineering approaches: stratospheric sulfate aerosol increase ({SAI}) that deflects sunlight to space and cirrus cloud thinning ({CCT}) that enables more longwave radiation to escape to space. Using the slab ocean configuration of National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model, we simulate {SAI} by uniformly adding sulfate aerosol in the upper stratosphere and {CCT} by uniformly increasing cirrus cloud ice particle falling speed. Under an idealized warming scenario of abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric {CO}2, we show that by combining appropriate amounts of {SAI} and {CCT} geoengineering, global mean (or land mean) temperature and precipitation can be restored simultaneously to preindustrial levels. However, compared to {SAI}, cocktail geoengineering by mixing {SAI} and {CCT} does not markedly improve the overall similarity between geoengineered climate and preindustrial climate on regional scales.

	abstract = {Over the coming century humanity may need to find reservoirs to store several trillions of tons of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emitted from fossil fuel combustion, which would otherwise cause dangerous climate change if it were left in the atmosphere. Carbon storage in the ocean as bicarbonate ions (by increasing ocean alkalinity) has received very little attention. Yet recent work suggests sufficient capacity to sequester copious quantities of {CO}2. It may be possible to sequester hundreds of billions to trillions of tons of C without surpassing postindustrial average carbonate saturation states in the surface ocean. When globally distributed, the impact of elevated alkalinity is potentially small and may help ameliorate the effects of ocean acidification. However, the local impact around addition sites may be more acute but is specific to the mineral and technology. The alkalinity of the ocean increases naturally because of rock weathering in which {\textgreater}1.5 mol of carbon are removed from the atmosphere for every mole of magnesium or calcium dissolved from silicate minerals (e.g., wollastonite, olivine, and anorthite) and 0.5 mol for carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite and dolomite). These processes are responsible for naturally sequestering 0.5 billion tons of {CO}2 per year. Alkalinity is reduced in the ocean through carbonate mineral precipitation, which is almost exclusively formed from biological activity. Most of the previous work on the biological response to changes in carbonate chemistry have focused on acidifying conditions. More research is required to understand carbonate precipitation at elevated alkalinity to constrain the longevity of carbon storage. A range of technologies have been proposed to increase ocean alkalinity (accelerated weathering of limestone, enhanced weathering, electrochemical promoted weathering, and ocean liming), the cost of which may be comparable to alternative carbon sequestration proposals (e.g., \$20–100 {tCO}2−1). There are still many unanswered technical, environmental, social, and ethical questions, but the scale of the carbon sequestration challenge warrants research to address these.},

Artificial acceleration of this carbon sink via distribution of pulverized silicate rocks across terrestrial landscapes may help offset anthropogenic {CO}2 emissions. We show that idealized enhanced weathering scenarios over less than a third of tropical land could cause significant drawdown of atmospheric {CO}2 and ameliorate ocean acidification by 2100. Global carbon cycle modelling driven by ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway ({RCP}) projections of twenty-first-century climate change ({RCP}8.5, business-as-usual; {RCP}4.5, medium-level mitigation) indicates that enhanced weathering could lower atmospheric {CO}2 by 30-300 ppm by 2100, depending mainly on silicate rock application rate (1 kg or 5 kg m-2 yr-1) and composition. At the higher application rate, end-of-century ocean acidification is reversed under {RCP}4.5 and reduced by about two-thirds under {RCP}8.5. Additionally, surface ocean aragonite saturation state, a key control on coral calcification rates, is maintained above 3.5 throughout the low latitudes, thereby helping maintain the viability of tropical coral reef ecosystems. However, we highlight major issues of cost, social acceptability, and potential unanticipated consequences that will limit utilization and emphasize the need for urgent efforts to phase down fossil fuel emissions.},

This process, referred to as ocean acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field studies have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with declining {pH}, [{CO}32-], and Ω. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms. Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century. While retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community, calcification over recent decades, determining the contribution of ocean acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is depressed compared with values expected for pre-industrial conditions, indicating that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide removal ({CDR}) technologies may be needed to meet climate change targets. A full understanding of public attitudes towards such approaches is currently lacking. Here we report a mixed-methods study on public perceptions of {CDR} in the United States and the United Kingdom, focusing on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and terrestrial enhanced rock weathering. A discourse of climate urgency had a substantial impact on perceptions, with {CDR} seen as offering too slow a response to the climate crisis. {CDR} also fails to reflect long-term hopes for a sustainable world, being interpreted as not addressing the root causes of climate change. A social license to operate may therefore depend on resolving these temporal dilemmas regarding both the short- and long-term implications of technology development. While research under well-controlled conditions is likely to be acceptable, at-scale deployment without corresponding efforts to reduce emissions may represent a red line for many people.},

	abstract = {We describe a process for capturing {CO}2 from the atmosphere in an industrial plant. The design captures ∼1 Mt-{CO}2/year in a continuous process using an aqueous {KOH} sorbent coupled to a calcium caustic recovery loop. We describe the design rationale, summarize performance of the major unit operations, and provide a capital cost breakdown developed with an independent consulting engineering firm. We report results from a pilot plant that provides data on performance of the major unit operations. We summarize the energy and material balance computed using an Aspen process simulation. When {CO}2 is delivered at 15 {MPa}, the design requires either 8.81 {GJ} of natural gas, or 5.25 {GJ} of gas and 366 {kWhr} of electricity, per ton of {CO}2 captured. Depending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs, the levelized cost per ton {CO}2 captured from the atmosphere ranges from 94 to 232 \$/t-{CO}2. An industrial process for large-scale capture of atmospheric {CO}2 ({DAC}) serves two roles. First, as a source of {CO}2 for making carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels, enabling carbon-free energy to be converted into high-energy-density fuels. Solar fuels, for example, may be produced at high-insolation low-cost locations from {DAC}-{CO}2 and electrolytic hydrogen using gas-to-liquids technology enabling decarbonization of difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. And second, {DAC} with {CO}2 sequestration allows carbon removal. The feasibility of {DAC} has been disputed, in part, because publications have not provided sufficient engineering detail to allow independent evaluation of costs. We provide an engineering cost basis for a commercial {DAC} system for which all major components are either drawn from well-established commercial heritage or described in sufficient detail to allow assessment by third parties. This design reflects roughly 100 person-years of development by Carbon Engineering.

	abstract = {The question of climate at high obliquity is raised in the context of both exoplanet studies (e.g. habitabil-ity) and paleoclimates studies (evidence for low-latitude glaciation during the Neoproterozoic and the ''Snowball Earth'' hypothesis). States of high obliquity, /, are distinctive in that, for / P 54 , the poles receive more solar radiation in the annual mean than the equator, opposite to the present day situation. In addition, the seasonal cycle of insolation is extreme, with the poles alternatively ''facing'' the Sun and sheltering in the dark for months. The novelty of our approach is to consider the role of a dynamical ocean in controlling the surface climate at high obliquity, which in turn requires understanding of the surface winds patterns when temperature gradients are reversed. To address these questions, a coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice {GCM} configured on an Aquaplanet is employed. Except for the absence of topography and modified obliquity, the setup is Earth-like. Two large obliquities /, 54° and 90°, are compared to today's Earth value, / = 23.5°. Three key results emerge at high obliquity: (1) despite reversed temperature gradients, mid-latitudes surface winds are westerly and trade winds exist at the equator (as for / = 23.5°) although the westerlies are confined to the summer hemisphere, (2) a habitable planet is possible with mid-latitude temperatures in the range 300-280 K and (3) a stable climate state with an ice cap limited to the equatorial region is unlikely. We clarify the dynamics behind these features (notably by an analysis of the potential vorticity structure and conditions for baroclinic instability of the atmosphere). Interestingly, we find that the absence of a stable partially glaciated state is critically linked to the absence of ocean heat transport during winter, a feature ultimately traced back to the high seasonality of baroclinic instability conditions in the atmosphere.},

These asymmetric migration responses are consistent with a simple model where rural-urban earnings differentials and liquidity constraints interact to determine rural-to-urban migration flows. We also confirm these temperature effects using country-level observations constructed by aggregating the grid cell level data. We project that expected warming in the next century will encourage further urbanization in middle-income countries such as Argentina, but it will slow down urban transition in poor countries like Malawi and Niger.},

The analysis suggests that the most stringent emissions policy considered here - which gives a 50\% chance of remaining below a 2C temperature rise target - reduces impacts by 20-65\% by 2100 relative to a 'business-as-usual' pathway which reaches 4C, and can delay impacts by several decades. The effects of mitigation policies vary between sectors and regions, and only a few are noticeable by 2030. The impacts avoided by 2100 are more strongly influenced by the date and level at which emissions peak than the rate of decline of emissions, with an earlier and lower emissions peak avoiding more impacts. The estimated proportion of impacts avoided at the global scale is relatively robust despite uncertainty in the spatial pattern of climate change, but the absolute amount of avoided impacts is considerably more variable and therefore uncertain. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Human populations are forcibly displaced, which are now referred to as climate-induced migrants. In this work we investigate which climate and structural factors forced major human displacements in the presence of floods and storms during years 2017-2019. We built, curated and harmonized a database of meteorological and remote sensing indicators along with structural factors of 27 developing countries worldwide. We show how we can use Gaussian Processes to learn what variables can explain the impact of floods and storms in a context of forced displacements and to develop models that reproduce migration flows. Our results at regional, global and disaster-specific scales show the importance of structural factors in the determination of the magnitude of displacements. The study may have both societal, political and economical implications. "When we escaped, we ran, without taking our belongings. Some of us ran barefoot.

Previous literature leads to different results and uses a multitude of traditional empirical approaches. This paper proposes a tree-based Machine Learning ({ML}) approach to analyze the role of the weather shocks towards an individual's intention to migrate in the six agriculture-dependent-economy countries such as Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. We perform several tree-based algorithms (e.g., {XGB}, Random Forest) using the train-validation-test workflow to build robust and noise-resistant approaches. Then we determine the important features showing in which direction they are influencing the migration intention. This {ML}-based estimation accounts for features such as weather shocks captured by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index ({SPEI}) for different timescales and various socioeconomic features/covariates. We find that (i) weather features improve the prediction performance although socioeconomic characteristics have more influence on migration intentions, (ii) country-specific model is necessary, and (iii) international move is influenced more by the longer timescales of {SPEIs} while general move (which includes internal move) by that of shorter timescales.},

We rely on projections from the most comprehensive published study in the epidemiology literature of future temperature impacts on mortality (Gasparrini et al. in Lancet Planet Health 1:e360–e367, 2017), which estimated changes in heat- and cold-related mortality for 23 countries over the twenty-first century. We model variation in these mortality projections as a function of baseline climate, future temperature change, and income variables and then project future changes in mortality for every country. We find significant spatial heterogeneity in projected mortality impacts, with hotter and poorer places more adversely affected than colder and richer places. In the absence of income-based adaptation, the global mortality rate in 2080–2099 is expected to increase by 1.8\% [95\% {CI} 0.8–2.8\%] under a lower-emissions {RCP} 4.5 scenario and by 6.2\% [95\% {CI} 2.5–10.0\%] in the very high-emissions {RCP} 8.5 scenario relative to 2001–2020. When the reduced sensitivity to heat associated with rising incomes, such as greater ability to invest in air conditioning, is accounted for, the expected end-of-century increase in the global mortality rate is 1.1\% [95\% {CI} 0.4–1.9\%] in {RCP} 4.5 and 4.2\% [95\% {CI} 1.8–6.7\%] in {RCP} 8.5. In addition, we compare recent estimates of climate-change induced excess mortality from diarrheal disease, malaria and dengue fever in 2030 and 2050 with current estimates used in {SCC} calculations and show these are likely underestimated in current {SCC} estimates, but are also small compared to more direct temperature effects.},

	abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric {CO}2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function ({PDF}) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6–3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3–4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5–95\% ranges are 2.3–4.7 K, bounded by 2.0–5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

We first evaluate an approach that weights simulations based on the realism and degree of independence of their 1970–2014 trends, by treating each historical simulation in turn as pseudo-observations, and using the other models and weighting method to predict 21st century warming in the model concerned. The method performs well based on correlation and probabilistic measures. Applying the method using the observed 1970–2014 warming trend results in only small changes in the mean and lower bound of {CMIP}6 projected warming but substantially reduces the upper bound of projected early-, mid- and late-21st century warming under all {SSP} scenarios.},

We provide weighted multimodel projections of Arctic sea ice and temperature as a case study to demonstrate that, for some questions at least, it is meaningless to treat all models equally. The constrained ensemble shows reduced spread and a more rapid sea ice decline than the unweighted ensemble.

To robustly quantify uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, inter-dependencies between models as well as a models ability to reproduce observations should be considered. Here, a model weighting approach, which accounts for both independence and performance, is applied to European temperature and precipitation projections from the {CMIP}5 archive. Two future periods representing mid- and end-of-century conditions driven by the high-emission scenario {RCP}8.5 are investigated. To inform the weighting, six diagnostics based on three observational estimates are used to also account for uncertainty in the observational record. Our findings show that weighting the ensemble can reduce the interquartile spread by more than 20\% in some regions, increasing the reliability of projected changes. The mean temperature change is most notably impacted by the weighting in the Mediterranean, where it is found to be 0.35 °C higher than the unweighted mean in the end-of-century period. For precipitation the largest differences are found for Northern Europe, with a relative decrease in precipitation of 2.4\% and 3.4\% for the two future periods compared to the unweighted case. Based on a perfect model test, it is found that weighting the ensemble leads to an increase in the investigated skill score for temperature and precipitation while minimizing the probability of overfitting.},

It has been argued that model uncertainty can be decreased by giving more weight to those models in multimodel ensembles that are more skillful and realistic for a specific process or application. In addition, some models in multimodel ensembles are not independent. We use a weighting approach proposed recently that takes into account both model performance and interdependence and apply it to investigate projections of summer maximum temperature climatology over North America in two regions of different sizes. We quantify the influence of predicting diagnostics included in the method, look at ways how to choose them, and assess the influence of the observational data set used. The trend in shortwave radiation, mean precipitation, sea surface temperature variability, and variability and trend in maximum temperature itself are the most promising constraints on projections of summer maximum temperature over North America. The influence of the observational data sets is large for summer temperature climatology, since the observational and reanalysis products used for absolute maximum temperatures disagree. Including multiple predicting diagnostics leads to more similar results for different data sets. We find that the weighted multimodel mean reduces the change in summer daily temperature maxima compared to the nonweighted mean slightly (0.05–0.45 °C) over the central United States. We show that it is essential to have reliable observations for key variables to be able to constrain multimodel ensembles of future projections.},

	abstract = {The sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}6) constitutes the latest update on expected future climate change based on a new generation of climate models. To extract reliable estimates of future warming and related uncertainties from these models, the spread in their projections is often translated into probabilistic estimates such as the mean and likely range. Here, we use a model weighting approach, which accounts for the models' historical performance based on several diagnostics as well as model interdependence within the {CMIP}6 ensemble, to calculate constrained distributions of global mean temperature change. We investigate the skill of our approach in a perfect model test, where we use previous-generation {CMIP}5 models as pseudo-observations in the historical period. The performance of the distribution weighted in the abovementioned manner with respect to matching the pseudo-observations in the future is then evaluated, and we find a mean increase in skill of about 17\% compared with the unweighted distribution. In addition, we show that our independence metric correctly clusters models known to be similar based on a {CMIP}6 "family tree", which enables the application of a weighting based on the degree of inter-model dependence. We then apply the weighting approach, based on two observational estimates (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Retrospective Analysis-{ERA}5, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2-{MERRA}-2), to constrain {CMIP}6 projections under weak ({SSP}1-2.6) and strong ({SSP}5-8.5) climate change scenarios ({SSP} refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Our results show a reduction in the projected mean warming for both scenarios because some {CMIP}6 models with high future warming receive systematically lower performance weights. The mean of end-of-century warming (2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014) for {SSP}5-8.5 with weighting is 3.7g C, compared with 4.1gC without weighting; the likely (66\%) uncertainty range is 3.1 to 4.6gC, which equates to a 13\% decrease in spread. For {SSP}1-2.6, the weighted end-of-century warming is 1gC (0.7 to 1.4gC), which results in a reduction of-0.1 {gC} in the mean and-24 \% in the likely range compared with the unweighted case.},

This problem hinders accounting for the potentially large impact of regional differences in dust properties on clouds, the Earth s energy balance, and terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we constrain the contribution of each of the world s main dust source regions to the global dust cycle. We use an analytical framework that integrates an ensemble of global aerosol model simulations with observationally informed constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth ({DAOD}). We obtain a dataset that constrains the relative contribution of nine major source regions to size-resolved dust emission, atmospheric loading, {DAOD}, concentration, and deposition flux. We find that the 22 29 Tg (1 standard error range) global loading of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 um is partitioned as follows: North African source regions contribute 50\% (11 15 Tg), Asian source regions contribute 40\% (8 13 Tg), and North American and Southern Hemisphere regions contribute 10\% (1.8 3.2 Tg). These results suggest that current models on average overestimate the contribution of North African sources to atmospheric dust loading at 65 \%, while underestimating the contribution of Asian dust at 30 \%. Our results further show that each source region s dust loading peaks in local spring and summer, which is partially driven by increased dust lifetime in those seasons. We also quantify the dust deposition flux to the Amazon rainforest to be 10 Tg yr1, which is a factor of 2 3 less than inferred from satellite data by previous work that likely overestimated dust deposition by underestimating the dust mass extinction efficiency. The data obtained in this paper can be used to obtain improved constraints on dust impacts on clouds, climate, biogeochemical cycles, and other parts of the Earth system.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is creating impacts that are widespread and se-vere—and in many cases irreversible—for individuals, communities, economies, and ecosystems around the world.Without decisive action and rapid stabiliza-tion of global temperature, risks from a changing climate will increase in the future, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Limiting future warming to substantially less than 2°C above preindustrial levels requires dramatic decreases in the emissions of all greenhouse gases ({GHGs}) from human activity, with net emissions of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) falling to zero in the second half of the 21st century. The potential to rapidly decrease {GHG} emissions is real, but progress in realizing that potential is insuf-ficient, and global {GHG} emissions continue at very high levels. In light of these urgent concerns and limited progress with solutions, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility and potential risks and benefits—and consequences for diverse stakeholders—of the wide range of possible policy responses to climate change.Meeting the challenge of climate change requires a portfolio of options. The center-piece of this portfolio should be reducing {GHG} emissions, removing and reliably se-questering carbon from the atmosphere, and pursuing adaptation to climate change impacts that have already occurred or will occur in the future. Concerns that these three options together are not being pursued at the level or pace needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change—or that even if vigorously pursued will not be sufficient to avoid the worst consequences—have led some to suggest the value of exploring additional response strategies. This includes solar geoengineering ({SG}),1which refers to attempts to moderate warming by increasing the amount of sunlight that the atmosphere reflects back to space or by reducing the trapping of outgoing thermal radiation (see Box S.1 and Figure S.1). To be effective, these {SG} strategies (like all climate change response efforts) would need to be continuously maintained for very long periods of time.},

	abstract = {Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth s atmosphere, atmospheric models struggle to accurately represent its spatial and temporal distribution. These model errors are partially caused by fundamental difficulties in simulating dust emission in coarseresolution models and in accurately representing dust microphysical properties. Here we mitigate these problems by developing a new methodology that yields an improved representation of the global dust cycle. We present an analytical framework that uses inverse modeling to integrate an ensemble of global model simulations with observational constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth.We then compare the inverse model results against independent measurements of dust surface concentration and deposition flux and find that errors are reduced by approximately a factor of 2 relative to current model simulations of the Northern Hemisphere dust cycle. The inverse model results show smaller improvements in the less dusty Southern Hemisphere, most likely because both the model simulations and the observational constraints used in the inverse model are less accurate. On a global basis, we find that the emission flux of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 um ({PM}20) is approximately 5000 Tg yr1, which is greater than most models account for. This larger {PM}20 dust flux is needed to match observational constraints showing a large atmospheric loading of coarse dust. We obtain gridded datasets of dust emission, vertically integrated loading, dust aerosol optical depth, (surface) concentration, and wet and dry deposition fluxes that are resolved by season and particle size. As our results indicate that this dataset is more accurate than current model simulations and the {MERRA}-2 dust reanalysis product, it can be used to improve quantifications of dust impacts on the Earth system.},

Here, we quantify the range in aerosol forcing associated with uncertainty in the location and magnitude of preindustrial fire emissions in a climate model based on four emission estimates. With varied emission location and magnitude among the fire estimates, we find the change in aerosol forcing from present-day to preindustrial is between −0.4 and 0.3 W/m2 for direct radiative forcing and between −1.8 and 0.6 W/m2 for cloud albedo forcing. Altering only the spatial distribution of preindustrial fires for a fixed magnitude adds a previously unaccounted 25\% uncertainty to the total aerosol radiative forcing range. Future studies must account for the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of fire and other aerosol emissions as regional differences contribute substantial additional uncertainty to anthropogenic radiative forcing estimates and the resultant climate sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Climate-aerosol model {ECHAM}5.5-{HAM}2 was used to investigate how geoengineering with artificial sea salt emissions would affect marine clouds and the Earth's radiative balance. Prognostic cloud droplet number concentration and interaction of aerosol particles with clouds and radiation were calculated explicitly, thus making this the first time that aerosol direct effects of sea spray geoengineering are considered. When a wind speed dependent baseline geoengineering flux was applied over all oceans (total annual emissions 443.9 Tg), we predicted a radiative flux perturbation ({RFP}) of -5.1 W m$^{\textrm{-2}}$, which is enough to counteract warming from doubled {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentration. When the baseline flux was limited to three persistent stratocumulus regions (3.3\% of Earth's surface, total annual emissions 20.6 Tg), the {RFP} was -0.8 Wm$^{\textrm{-2}}$ resulting mainly from a 74-80\% increase in cloud droplet number concentration and a 2.5-4.4 percentage point increase in cloud cover. Multiplying the baseline mass flux by 5 or reducing the injected particle size from 250 to 100 nm had comparable effects on the geoengineering efficiency with {RFPs} -2.2 and -2.1 Wm$^{\textrm{-2}}$, respectively. Within regions characterized with persistent stratocumulus decks, practically all of the radiative effect originated from aerosol indirect effects. However, when all oceanic regions were seeded, the direct effect with the baseline flux was globally about 29\% of the total radiative effect. Together with previous studies, our results indicate that there are still large uncertainties associated with the sea spray geoengineering efficiency due to variations in e.g., background aerosol concentration, updraft velocity, cloud altitude and onset of precipitation.

	abstract = {To counteract global warming, there have been suggestions to increase the albedo of low-level marine clouds through the aerosol indirect effects by injecting them with sea salt. However, the full climate response to this geoengineering scheme is currently poorly understood. We simulate cloud seeding in a coupled mixed-layer ocean-atmosphere general circulation model in order to identify the specific physical mechanisms through which seeding could perturb the climate system's radiative balance, and cause temperature and precipitation changes. Seeding stratocumulus decks over three tropical maritime regions in the North Pacific, South Pacific and South Atlantic produces strong local reductions in solar absorption. Over half of the radiative cooling is due to direct scattering of solar radiation by the added sea salt aerosols, while the rest comes from enhancement of the local cloud albedo. The oceanic cooling due to the seeding over the southeastern equatorial Pacific induces a La Nia-like response, with tropical precipitation changes resembling La Nia anomalies and teleconnections occurring in the mid-latitude North Pacific and North America. Additionally, model runs in which only one of the three regions is seeded indicate nonlinearity in the climate response. We identify dynamical and thermodynamical constraints respectively on the temperature and hydrological cycle responses to cloud seeding, but the full response to such geoengineering remains poorly constrained. © 2012.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that changes in solar radiation affect the hydrological cycle more strongly than equivalent {CO}2 changes for the same change in global mean surface temperature. Thus, solar radiation management "geoengineering" proposals to completely offset global mean temperature increases by reducing the amount of absorbed sunlight might be expected to slow the global water cycle and reduce runoff over land. However, proposed countering of global warming by increasing the albedo of marine clouds would reduce surface solar radiation only over the oceans. Here, for an idealized scenario, we analyze the response of temperature and the hydrological cycle to increased reflection by clouds over the ocean using an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. When cloud droplets are reduced in size over all oceans uniformly to offset the temperature increase from a doubling of atmospheric {CO}2, the global-mean precipitation and evaporation decreases by about 1.3\% but runoff over land increases by 7.5\% primarily due to increases over tropical land. In the model, more reflective marine clouds cool the atmospheric column over ocean. The result is a sinking motion over oceans and upward motion over land. We attribute the increased runoff over land to this increased upward motion over land when marine clouds are made more reflective. Our results suggest that, in contrast to other proposals to increase planetary albedo, offsetting mean global warming by reducing marine cloud droplet size does not necessarily lead to a drying, on average, of the continents. However, we note that the changes in precipitation, evaporation and P-E are dominated by small but significant areas, and given the highly idealized nature of this study, a more thorough and broader assessment would be required for proposals of altering marine cloud properties on a large scale. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Theoretical potential geoengineering solutions to the global warming problem have recently been proposed. Here, we present an idealized study of the climate response to deliberately seeding large-scale stratocumulus cloud decks in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic, thereby inducing cooling via aerosol indirect effects. Atmosphere-only, atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean, and fully coupled atmosphere/ocean versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model are used to investigate the radiative forcing, climate efficacy, and regional response of temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity to such geoengineering. The radiative forcing simulations indicate that, for our parameterization of aerosol indirect effects, up to 35\% of the radiative forcing due to current levels of greenhouse gases could be offset by stratocumulus modification. Equilibrium simulations with the atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean model, wherein each of the three stratocumulus sheets is modified in turn, reveal that the most efficient cooling per unit radiative forcing occurs when the South Pacific stratocumulus sheet is modified. Transient coupled model simulations suggest that geoengineering all three stratocumulus areas delays the simulated global warming by about 25 years. These simulations also indicate that, while some areas experience increases in precipitation and net primary productivity, sharp decreases are simulated in South America, with particularly detrimental impacts on the Amazon rain forest. These results show that, while some areas benefit from geoengineering, there are significant areas where the response could be very detrimental with implications for the practical applicability of such a scheme.},

	abstract = {Marine cloud brightening through sea spray injection has been proposed as a climate engineering method for avoiding the most severe consequences of global warming. A limitation of most of the previous modelling studies on marine cloud brightening is that they have either considered individual models or only investigated the effects of a specific increase in the number of cloud droplets. Here we present results from coordinated simulations with three Earth system models ({ESMs}) participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project ({GeoMIP}) G4sea-salt experiment. Injection rates of accumulation-mode sea spray aerosol particles over ocean between 30°ĝ€N and 30°ĝ€S are set in each model to generate a global-mean effective radiative forcing ({ERF}) of ĝ'2.0ĝ€Wĝ€†mĝ'2 at the top of the atmosphere. We find that the injection increases the cloud droplet number concentration in lower layers, reduces the cloud-top effective droplet radius, and increases the cloud optical depth over the injection area. We also find, however, that the global-mean clear-sky {ERF} by the injected particles is as large as the corresponding total {ERF} in all three {ESMs}, indicating a large potential of the aerosol direct effect in regions of low cloudiness. The largest enhancement in {ERF} due to the presence of clouds occur as expected in the subtropical stratocumulus regions off the west coasts of the American and African continents. However, outside these regions, the {ERF} is in general equally large in cloudy and clear-sky conditions. These findings suggest a more important role of the aerosol direct effect in sea spray climate engineering than previously thought.},

Using the slab ocean configuration of National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model, we simulate {SAI} by uniformly adding sulfate aerosol in the upper stratosphere and {CCT} by uniformly increasing cirrus cloud ice particle falling speed. Under an idealized warming scenario of abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric {CO}2, we show that by combining appropriate amounts of {SAI} and {CCT} geoengineering, global mean (or land mean) temperature and precipitation can be restored simultaneously to preindustrial levels. However, compared to {SAI}, cocktail geoengineering by mixing {SAI} and {CCT} does not markedly improve the overall similarity between geoengineered climate and preindustrial climate on regional scales. Some optimal spatially nonuniform mixture of {SAI} with {CCT} might have the potential to better mitigate climate change at both the global and regional scales.},

	abstract = {Solar geoengineering - deliberate reduction in the amount of solar radiation retained by the Earth - has been proposed as a means of counteracting some of the climatic effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We present results from Experiment G1 of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, in which 12 climate models have simulated the climate response to an abrupt quadrupling of {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} from preindustrial concentrations brought into radiative balance via a globally uniform reduction in insolation. Models show this reduction largely offsets global mean surface temperature increases due to quadrupled {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentrations and prevents 97\% of the Arctic sea ice loss that would otherwise occur under high {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} levels but, compared to the preindustrial climate, leaves the tropics cooler (-0.3 K) and the poles warmer (+0.8 K). Annual mean precipitation minus evaporation anomalies for G1 are less than 0.2 mm day$^{\textrm{-1}}$ in magnitude over 92\% of the globe, but some tropical regions receive less precipitation, in part due to increased moist static stability and suppression of convection. Global average net primary productivity increases by 120\% in G1 over simulated preindustrial levels, primarily from {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} fertilization, but also in part due to reduced plant heat stress compared to a high {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} world with no geoengineering. All models show that uniform solar geoengineering in G1 cannot simultaneously return regional and global temperature and hydrologic cycle intensity to preindustrial levels.

	abstract = {Climate models struggle to accurately represent the highly reflective boundary layer clouds overlying the remote and stormy Southern Ocean. We use in situ aircraft observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation and Aerosol Transport Experimental Study ({SOCRATES}) to evaluate Southern Ocean clouds in a cloud-resolving large-eddy simulation ({LES}) and two coarse resolution global atmospheric models, the {CESM} Community Atmosphere Model ({CAM}6) and the {GFDL} Atmosphere Model ({AM}4), run in a nudged hindcast framework. We develop six case studies from {SOCRATES} data which span the range of observed cloud and boundary layer properties. For each case, the {LES} is run once forced purely using reanalysis data (fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis, “{ERA}5 based”) and once strongly nudged to an aircraft profile(“Obs based”). The {ERA}5-based {LES} can be compared with the global models, which are also nudged to reanalysis data and are better for simulating cumulus. The Obs-based {LES} closely matches an observed cloud profile and is useful for microphysical comparisons and sensitivity tests and simulating multilayer stratiform clouds. We use two-moment Morrison microphysics in the {LES} and find that it simulates too few frozen particles in clouds occurring within the Hallett-Mossop temperature range. We tweak the Hallett-Mossop parameterization so that it activates within boundary layer clouds, and we achieve better agreement between observed and simulated microphysics. The nudged global climate models ({GCMs}) simulate liquid-dominated mixed-phase clouds in the stratiform cases but excessively glaciate cumulus clouds. Both {GCMs} struggle to represent two-layer clouds, and {CAM}6 has low droplet concentrations in all cases and underpredicts stratiform cloud-driven turbulence.},

We start by distinguishing two purposes of estimation: to estimate population descriptive statistics and to estimate causal effects. In the former type of research, weighting is called for when it is needed to make the analysis sample representative of the target population. In the latter type, the weighting issue is more nuanced. We discuss three distinct potential motives for weighting when estimating causal effects: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity, (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling, and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does. We recommend diagnostics for assessing the advisability of weighting, and we suggest methods for appropriate inference.},

These asymmetric migration responses are consistent with a simple model where rural-urban earnings differentials and liquidity constraints interact to determine rural-to-urban migration flows. We also confirm these temperature effects using country-level observations constructed by aggregating the grid cell level data. We project that expected warming in the next century will encourage further urbanization in middle-income countries such as Argentina, but it will slow down urban transition in poor countries like Malawi and Niger.},

We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between temperature and international outmigration only in the most agriculture-dependent countries, consistent with the widely documented adverse impact of temperature on agricultural productivity. Further, the temperature–migration relationship is nonlinear and resembles the nonlinear temperature–yield relationship. In addition, migration flows to current major destinations are especially temperature-sensitive. Policies to address issues related to climate-induced international migration would be more efficient if focused on the agriculture-dependent countries and especially people in those countries whose livelihoods depend on agriculture.},

Using data from 115 countries between 1960 and 2000, we analyze the effect of differential warming trends across countries on the probability of either migrating out of the country or from rural to urban areas. We find that higher temperatures in middle-income economies increased migration rates to urban areas and to other countries. In poor countries, higher temperatures reduced the probability of migration to cities and to other countries, consistently with the presence of severe liquidity constraints. In middle-income countries, migration represents an important margin of adjustment to global warming, potentially contributing to structural change and even increasing income per worker.

Human migration attributable to climate events has recently received significant attention from the academic and policy communities 1,2. Quantitative evidence on the relationship between individual, permanent migration and natural disasters is limited 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. A 21-year longitudinal survey conducted in rural Pakistan (1991–2012) provides a unique opportunity to understand the relationship between weather and long-term migration. We link individual-level information from this survey to satellite-derived measures of climate variability and control for potential confounders using a multivariate approach. We find that flooding—a climate shock associated with large relief efforts—has modest to insignificant impacts on migration. Heat stress, however—which has attracted relatively little relief—consistently increases the long-term migration of men, driven by a negative effect on farm and non-farm income. Addressing weather-related displacement will require policies that both enhance resilience to climate shocks and lower barriers to welfare-enhancing population movements.},

Our model uses the seasonality of the sensitivity of corn yields to extreme heat over the growing season, which peaks during corn flowering, as instrument. Unless people inside the Corn Belt (but not outside the Corn Belt) have a distaste for heat that varies year-to-year with corn flowering, our results are driven by a change in agricultural productivity and not a direct preference for climate. A one percent change in yields leads to an opposite 0.3-0.4 percentage point change in the net migration rate in rural counties of the Corn Belt. Since agricultural demand is highly inelastic, price feedbacks have the potential to more than offset the effect of production declines on migration. A novel model that includes both local as well as the global production shocks allows us to differentiate between the decline in productivity due to climate change and the effect of price feedbacks occurring when {US} production shocks are not offset somewhere else.},

By lowering farm incomes, reduced moisture availability encourages migration to nearby cities, while wetter conditions slow migration. The paper also provides evidence for rural-urban income links. In countries with a larger industrial base, reduced moisture shrinks the agricultural sector and raises total incomes in nearby cities. However, if local cities are entirely dependent on servicing agriculture so their fortunes move with those of agriculture, reduced moisture tends to reduce local urban incomes. Finally, the paper shows that climate induces employment changes within the rural sector itself. Drier conditions induce a shift out of farm activities, especially for women, into non-farm activities, and especially out of the workforce. Overall, these findings imply a strong link between climate and urbanization in Africa.},

This lack of urban focus is unfortunate given the sheer numbers of urban residents and continuing high levels of urbanization. To begin filling this empirical gap, this study investigates climate change impacts on {US}-bound migration from rural and urban Mexico, 1986-1999. We employ geostatistical interpolation methods to construct two climate change indices, capturing warm and wet spell duration, based on daily temperature and precipitation readings for 214 weather stations across Mexico. In combination with detailed migration histories obtained from the Mexican Migration Project, we model the influence of climate change on household-level migration from 68 rural and 49 urban municipalities. Results from multilevel event-history models reveal that a temperature warming and excessive precipitation significantly increased international migration during the study period. However, climate change impacts on international migration is only observed for rural areas. Interactions reveal a causal pathway in which temperature (but not precipitation) influences migration patterns through employment in the agricultural sector. As such, climate-related international migration may decline with continued urbanization and the resulting reductions in direct dependence of households on rural agriculture.},

Combining data from the latest census in Yemen with a weather database as well as other geographic information, we assess the push and pull factors that may drive migration. These factors include climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall and their variability, socio-economic factors such as the attractiveness of the areas of origin and destination among others in terms of employment, education, and irrigation, and cost factors as proxied by the distance between the places of origin and destination. The results suggest that climate variables do affect migration, but in a limited way, with socio-economic and cost factors playing a much more prominent role. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	title = {Migration Choice under Risk and Liquidity Constraints},
	url = {https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/200702},
	abstract = {This paper develops and tests a migration choice model that incorporates two prominent migration strategies used by households facing risk and liquidity constraints. On the one hand, migration can be used as an ex-post risk-coping strategy after sudden negative income shocks. On the other hand, migration can be seen an as investment, but liquidity constraints may prevent households from paying up-front migration costs, in which case positive income shocks may increase migration. These diverging migratory responses to shocks are modeled within a dynamic migration choice framework that I test using a 20-year panel of internal migration decisions by 38,914 individuals in Indonesia. I document evidence that migration increases after contemporaneous negative income shocks as well as after an accumulation of preceding positive shocks. Consistent with the model, I find that migration after negative shocks is more often characterized by temporary moves to rural destinations and is more likely to be used by those with low levels of wealth, while investment migration is more likely to involve urban destinations, occur over longer distances, and be longer in duration. Structural estimation of the model reveals that migration costs are higher for those with lower levels of wealth and education, and suggests that the two migration strategies act as substitutes, meaning that those who migrate to cope with a negative shock are less likely to invest in migration. I use the structural estimates to simulate policy experiments of providing credit and subsidizing migration, and I explore the impact of increased weather shock intensity in order to better understand the possible impact of climate change on migration.},

	abstract = {We present a microlevel study to simultaneously investigate the effects of variations in temperature and precipitation along with sudden natural disasters to infer their relative influence on migration that is likely permanent. The study is made possible by the availability of household panel data from Indonesia with an exceptional tracking rate combined with frequent occurrence of natural disasters and significant climatic variations, thus providing a quasi-experiment to examine the influence of environment on migration. Using data on 7,185 households followed over 15 y, we analyze whole-household, province-to-province migration, which allows us to understand the effects of environmental factors on permanent moves that may differ from temporary migration. The results suggest that permanent migration is influenced by climatic variations, whereas episodic disasters tend to have much smaller or no impact on such migration. In particular, temperature has a nonlinear effect on migration such that above 25°C, a rise in temperature is related to an increase in outmigration, potentially through its impact on economic conditions. We use these results to estimate the impact of projected temperature increases on future permanent migration. Though precipitation also has a similar non-linear effect on migration, the effect is smaller than that of temperature, underscoring the importance of using an expanded set of climatic factors as predictors of migration. These findings on the minimal influence of natural disasters and precipitation on permanent moves supplement previous findings on the significant role of these variables in promoting temporary migration.},

We use a 28-year panel of individuals to investigate how people adjust their sector and location of work in response to year-to-year variation in weather. Controlling for state-year and individual fixed effects, we find that individuals are less likely to work locally in years with a high occurrence of extreme heat. This reduction in labor occurs for both agricultural and non-agricultural jobs, with larger reductions among wage workers. Extreme heat early in the year or for individuals located close to the U.S. border increases the likelihood that individuals respond by migrating to the United States. Under two medium-emissions climate change scenarios, our results imply that increased temperatures will lead to a 1.2-3\% decrease in local employment and a 1-2\% increase in domestic migration from rural to urban areas. These results provide an important example of how climate change could impact rural labor markets in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Economic productivity is shown to peak at an annual average temperature of 13 °C and decline at high temperatures, indicating that climate change is expected to lower global incomes more than 20\% by 2100. Temperature, and therefore climate change, can affect a country's economic productivity, but it has not been clear if rich and poor countries, or different aspects of economic productivity, show similar relationships. These authors use economic data from 166 countries for the years 1960 to 2010 to uncover a universal nonlinear relationship that reconciles earlier results. Economic productivity peaks at an annual average temperature of 13 °C, and the authors explore the likelihood of global economic contraction under future warming scenarios. Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies1,2, but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries3,4. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature5, while poor countries respond only linearly5,6. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human–natural systems7,8 and to anticipating the global impact of climate change9,10. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13 °C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change11,12, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23\% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.},

In this study we introduce a new multifunctional software tool (Particle Loss Calculator, {PLC}) that can be used to quickly determine aerosol sampling efficiency and particle transport losses due to passage through arbitrary tubing systems. The software employs relevant empirical and theoretical relationships found in established literature and accounts for the most important sampling and transport effects that might be encountered during deployment of typical, ground-based ambient aerosol measurements through a constant-diameter sampling probe. The software treats non-isoaxial and non-isokinetic aerosol sampling, aerosol diffusion and sedimentation as well as turbulent inertial deposition and inertial deposition in bends and contractions of tubing. This software was validated through comparison with experimentally determined particle losses for several tubing systems bent to create various diffusion, sedimentation and inertial deposition properties. As long as the tube geometries are not "too extreme", agreement is satisfactory. We discuss the conclusions of these experiments, the limitations of the software and present three examples of the use of the Particle Loss Calculator in the field.},

The emphasis is placed on the physical and chemical properties of tropospheric aerosols. There are two major sources of atmospheric aerosols: widespread surface sources and spatial sources. Widespread surface sources means sources at the base of the atmospheric volume (for example, oceans and deserts). Spatial sources refer to those within the atmospheric volume (for example, {GPC} and clouds). Additional point sources, such as volcanoes, are globally important in their influence on the stratosphere. Otherwise, because of short tropospheric residence times, aerosols from point sources affect mainly regional and local scales. The extreme variability of tropospheric aerosols gives rise to many problems and questions. Because of the short residence time of tropospheric aerosols (the residence time of water is comparable to that of aerosols), measuring networks with the density of precipitation networks are necessary to understand atmospheric aerosols. Sound strategies are needed to obtain the most useful and reliable measurements, particularly as dense measuring networks are unlikely to become available. © 1993 Academic Press Inc.},

The {NAAMES} measurements show moderate to strong correlations (0.56 {\textless} R {\textless} 0.70) between {NSSA} and local wind speeds in the marine boundary layer on hourly timescales, but this relationship weakens in the campaign averages that represent each season, in part because of the reduction in range of wind speed by multiday averaging. {NSSA} correlates weakly with seawater cp,660 (R = 0.36, P {\textless}{\textless} 0.01), but the correlation with cp,660, is improved (R = 0.51, P {\textless} 0.05) for periods of low wind speeds. In addition, {NAAMES} measurements provide observational dependence of {SSA} mode diameter (dm) on {SST}, with dm increasing to larger sizes at higher {SST} (R = 0.60, P {\textless}{\textless} 0.01) on hourly timescales. These results imply that climate models using bimodal {SSA} parameterizations to wind speed rather than a single {SSA} mode that varies with {SST} may overestimate {SSA} number concentrations (hence cloud condensation nuclei) by a factor of 4 to 7 and may underestimate {SSA} scattering (hence direct radiative effects) by a factor of 2 to 5, in addition to overpredicting variability in {SSA} scattering from wind speed by a factor of 5.},

Here, using a global panel of subnational economic output for 1,554 regions worldwide over the past 40 years, we show that economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and in extreme daily rainfall, in addition to responding nonlinearly to the total annual and to the standardized monthly deviations of rainfall. Furthermore, high-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most strongly hindered by both measures of daily rainfall, complementing previous work that emphasized the beneficial effects of additional total annual rainfall in low-income, agriculturally dependent economies4,7. By assessing the distribution of rainfall at multiple timescales and the effects on different sectors, we uncover channels through which climatic conditions can affect the economy. These results suggest that anthropogenic intensification of daily rainfall extremes8–10 will have negative global economic consequences that require further assessment by those who wish to evaluate the costs of anthropogenic climate change. A global assessment shows that increases in the number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall adversely affect economic growth, particularly in high-income nations and via the services and manufacturing sectors.},

Eighteen of the nanoparticle events showed particle growth and occurred during mornings when peaks in mixing ratios of α- and β-pinene and ozone made production of condensable products from photochemical oxidation probable. Many pollutants and other potential precursors for aerosol formation were also at elevated mixing ratios during these events, including {NO}, {HNO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, {NH}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, {HCl}, propane, and several other volatile organic carbon compounds. There were no consistent changes in particle composition, although both submicron and supermicron particles included high maximum concentrations of methane sulfonate, sulfate, iodide, nitrate, and ammonium during these events. Nanoparticle growth continued over several hours with a nearly linear rate of increase of diameter with time. The observed nanoparticle growth rates varied from 3 to 13 nm h$^{\textrm{-1}}$. Apparent nanoparticle aerosol mass fractions (yields) were estimated to range from less than 0.0005 to almost 1 using α- and β-pinene as the presumed particle source. These apparent high aerosol mass fractions (yields) at low changes in aerosol mass are up to two orders of magnitude greater than predictions from extrapolated laboratory parameterizations and may provide a more accurate assessment of secondary organic aerosol formation for estimating the growth of nanoparticles in global models.

Unfortunately, pledges made from countries thus far will not limit warming to below 1.5 °C, even after accounting for the more ambitious targets set at the recent {COP}26 climate summit in Glasgow (1). Meeting the 1.5 °C Paris Agreement goal will likely require a massive deployment of {CO}2 removal technologies that remain unproven at scale (2). As a result, many scientists—including an expert panel recently convened by the {US} National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine ({NASEM})—have advocated for research into solar climate interventions that would offset some effects of greenhouse gas-driven warming by reflecting more sunlight back to space (3). This would temporarily cool the Earth, giving mitigation and adaptation efforts more time to scale up. One such approach, marine cloud brightening ({MCB}), would seed low-altitude clouds over the ocean with salt particles to produce more and smaller cloud droplets, leading to brighter clouds (4, 5). We endorse the need for a transdisciplinary research program focused on {MCB} and other solar climate interventions. However, climate intervention research currently lacks a comprehensive framework to objectively produce and assess the information needed for sound decision-making. This is attributable in part to a lack of formal national or international research programs and governance. Without such a framework, future research investments are at risk of being unbalanced or misguided and thus failing to efficiently produce and disseminate policy-relevant knowledge in a timely manner. When considering the feasibility of a given climate intervention, we need to determine the key questions that require the most work (i.e., What should researchers study?). And we need criteria for terminating research on non-viable proposals (i.e., When should we stop?). Our goal here is twofold. First, we … [↵][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

	abstract = {Arctic geoengineering wherein sunlight absorption is reduced only in the Arctic has been suggested as a remedial measure to counteract the on-going rapid climate change in the Arctic. Several modeling studies have shown that Arctic geoengineering can minimize Arctic warming but will shift the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone ({ITCZ}) southward, unless offset by comparable geoengineering in the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, we investigate and quantify the implications of this {ITCZ} shift due to Arctic geoengineering for the global monsoon regions using the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 coupled to a slab ocean model. A doubling of {CO}2 from pre-industrial levels leads to a warming of {\textasciitilde}6 K in the Arctic region and precipitation in the monsoon regions increases by up to {\textasciitilde}15\%. In our Arctic geoengineering simulation which illustrates a plausible latitudinal distribution of the reduction in sunlight, an addition of sulfate aerosols (11 Mt) in the Arctic stratosphere nearly offsets the Arctic warming due to {CO}2 doubling but this shifts the {ITCZ} southward by {\textasciitilde}1.5° relative to the pre-industrial climate. The combined effect from this shift and the residual {CO}2-induced climate change in the tropics is a decrease/increase in annual mean precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere/Southern Hemisphere monsoon regions by up to −12/+17\%. Polar geoengineering where sulfate aerosols are prescribed in both the Arctic (10 Mt) and Antarctic (8 Mt) nearly offsets the {ITCZ} shift due to Arctic geoengineering, but there is still a residual precipitation increase (up to 7\%) in most monsoon regions associated with the residual {CO}2 induced warming in the tropics. The {ITCZ} shift due to our Global geoengineering simulation, where aerosols (20 Mt) are prescribed uniformly around the globe, is much smaller and the precipitation changes in most monsoon regions are within ±2\% as the residual {CO}2-induced warming in the tropics is also much less than in Arctic and Polar geoengineering. Further, global geoengineering nearly offsets the Arctic warming. Based on our results we infer that Arctic geoengineering leads to {ITCZ} shift and leaves residual {CO}2 induced warming in the tropics resulting in substantial precipitation decreases (increases) in the Northern (Southern) hemisphere monsoon regions.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that changes in solar radiation affect the hydrological cycle more strongly than equivalent {CO}2 changes for the same change in global mean surface temperature. Thus, solar radiation management "geoengineering" proposals to completely offset global mean temperature increases by reducing the amount of absorbed sunlight might be expected to slow the global water cycle and reduce runoff over land. However, proposed countering of global warming by increasing the albedo of marine clouds would reduce surface solar radiation only over the oceans. Here, for an idealized scenario, we analyze the response of temperature and the hydrological cycle to increased reflection by clouds over the ocean using an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. When cloud droplets are reduced in size over all oceans uniformly to offset the temperature increase from a doubling of atmospheric {CO}2, the global-mean precipitation and evaporation decreases by about 1.3\% but runoff over land increases by 7.5\% primarily due to increases over tropical land. In the model, more reflective marine clouds cool the atmospheric column over ocean. The result is a sinking motion over oceans and upward motion over land. We attribute the increased runoff over land to this increased upward motion over land when marine clouds are made more reflective. Our results suggest that, in contrast to other proposals to increase planetary albedo, offsetting mean global warming by reducing marine cloud droplet size does not necessarily lead to a drying, on average, of the continents. However, we note that the changes in precipitation, evaporation and P-E are dominated by small but significant areas, and given the highly idealized nature of this study, a more thorough and broader assessment would be required for proposals of altering marine cloud properties on a large scale. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Persistent greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions threaten global climate goals and have prompted consideration of climate controls supplementary to emissions mitigation. We present {MARGO}, an idealized model of optimally-controlled climate change, which is complementary to both simpler conceptual models and more complicated Integrated Assessment Models. The four methods of controlling climate damage - mitigation, carbon dioxide removal ({CDR}), adaptation, and solar radiation modification ({SRM}) - are not interchangeable, as they enter at different stages of the causal chain that connects {GHG} emissions to climate damages. Early and aggressive mitigation is necessary to stabilize {GHG} concentrations below a tolerable level. While the most cost-beneficial and cost-effective pathways to reducing climate suffering include deployments of all four controls, the quantitative trade-offs between the different controls are sensitive to value-driven parameters and poorly-known future costs and damages. Static policy optimization assumes perfect foresight and obscures the active role decision-makers have in shaping a climate trajectory. We propose an explicit policy response process wherein climate control policies are re-adjusted over time in response to unanticipated outcomes. We illustrate this process in two 'storyline' scenarios: (a) near-term increases in mitigation and {CDR} are deficient, such that climate goals are expected to slip out of reach; (b) {SRM} is abruptly terminated after 40 years of successful deployment, causing an extremely rapid warming which is amplified by an excess of {GHGs} due to deterred mitigation. In both cases, an optimized policy response yields substantial benefits relative to continuing the original policy. The {MARGO} model is intentionally designed to be as simple, transparent, customizable, and accessible as possible, addressing concerns about previous climate-economic modelling approaches and enabling a more diverse set of stakeholders to engage with these essential and timely topics.},

The chemical composition of individual atmospheric aerosol particles showed two types of sulfate-containing particles in clean marine air masses in addition to mass-based Estimated Salt particles. Both types of sulfate particles lack combustion tracers and correlate, for some conditions, to atmospheric or seawater dimethyl sulfide ({DMS}) concentrations, which means their source was largely biogenic. The first type is identified as New Sulfate because their large sulfate mass fraction (63\% sulfate) and association with entrainment conditions means they could have formed by nucleation in the free troposphere. The second type is Added Sulfate particles (38\% sulfate), because they are preexisting particles onto which additional sulfate condensed. New Sulfate particles accounted for 31\% (7 cm-3) and 33\% (36 cm-3) {CCN} at 0.1\% supersaturation in late-autumn and late-spring, respectively, whereas sea spray provided 55\% (13 cm-3) in late-autumn but only 4\% (4 cm-3) in late-spring.

	abstract = {Solar radiation management ({SRM}) has been proposed as a form of geoengineering to reduce the climate effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Modeling studies have concluded that {SRM}, through a reduction in total solar irradiance by approximately 2\%, roughly compensates for global mean temperature changes from a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. This paper examines the impact of {SRM} on the terrestrial hydrologic cycle using the Community Land Model, version 4, coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model, version 4, with reductions in solar radiation relative to simulations with present-day and elevated {CO}2 concentrations. There are significant global and regional impacts due to vegetation-climate interactions that are not compensated when reductions in total solar irradiance of 1\%, 2\%, and 3\% are imposed on top of a doubling of present-day {CO}2 concentrations. Water cycling slows down under {SRM}, including decreases in global mean precipitation and evapotranspiration. Changes in runoffand soil moisture are spatially and temporally variable, with implications for local water availability. In the tropics, evapotranspiration decreases because of increases in vegetation water use efficiency. In northern midlatitudes, soil moisture increases when evapotranspiration decreases, with some exceptions during boreal summer. Changes in soil evaporation influence water cycling in the southern subtropics, rather than changes in transpiration. The hydrologic response to {SRM} is nonlinear, with global mean decreases greater than expected. These results imply that {SRM} may not compensate for higher greenhouse gas concentrations when one considers land-atmosphere interactions.},

	abstract = {The idea of modifying cirrus clouds to directly counteract greenhouse gas warming has gained momentum in recent years, despite disputes over its physical feasibility. Previous studies that analyzed modifications of cirrus clouds by seeding of ice nucleating particles showed large uncertainties in both cloud and surface climate responses, ranging from no effect or even a small warming to a globally averaged cooling of about 2.5 C. We use two general circulation models that showed very different responses in previous studies, {ECHAM}6-{HAM} and {CESM}-{CAM}5, to determine which radiative and climatic responses to cirrus cloud seeding in a 1.5 {CO}2 world are common and which are not. Seeding reduces the net cirrus radiative effect for -1.8 W m-2 in {CESM} compared with only -0.8 W m-2 in {ECHAM}. Accordingly, the surface temperature decrease is larger in {CESM}, counteracting about 70\% of the global mean temperature increase due to {CO}2 and only 30\% in {ECHAM}. While seeding impacts on mean precipitation were addressed in past studies, we are the first to analyze extreme precipitation responses to cirrus seeding. Seeding decreases the frequency of the most extreme precipitation globally. However, the extreme precipitation events occur more frequently in the Sahel and Central America, following the mean precipitation increase due to a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, we use a quadratic climate damage metric to evaluate the amount of {CO}2-induced damage cirrus seeding can counteract. Seeding decreases the damage by about 50\% in {ECHAM}, and by 85\% in {CESM} over the 21 selected land regions. Climate damage due to {CO}2 increase is significantly reduced as a result of seeding in all of the considered land regions.},

Using a global climate model, we investigate the hydrological cycle response to "cirrus cloud thinning ({CCT})," which is a proposed climate engineering technique that seeks to enhance outgoing longwave radiation. Investigations of the "fast response" in experiments with fixed sea surface temperatures reveal that {CCT} causes a significant enhancement of the latent heat flux and precipitation. This is due to enhanced radiative cooling of the troposphere, which is opposite to the effect of increased {CO}2 concentrations. By combining {CCT} with {CO}2 increase in multidecadal simulations with a slab ocean, we demonstrate a systematic enhancement of the hydrological cycle due to {CCT}.

The cloud properties and climatic effects due to perturbing the ice crystal fall speed are investigated in a set of hemispheric scale sensitivity experiments with the Community Earth System Model. It is found that increasing the ice crystal fall speed, as an analog to cirrus cloud seeding, depletes high-level clouds and reduces the longwave cloud forcing. Deliberate depletion of cirrus clouds increases outgoing longwave radiation, reduces the upper tropospheric water vapor, and cools the climate. Global cirrus cloud thinning gave a net cloud forcing change of −1.55 Wm−2 and a global annual mean temperature change of −0.94 K. Though there is negligible change in the global annual mean precipitation (−0.001 mm/d), the spatially nonhomogeneous forcing induces circulation changes and hence remote climate changes. Climate engineering the Southern Hemisphere only results in a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and possible Sahelian drought alleviation, while targeting the Northern Hemisphere alone causes a greater cooling. It was found that targeting cirrus clouds everywhere outside of the tropics results in changes to the circulation and precipitation even in the nonclimate engineered regions, underscoring the risks of remote side effects and indeed the complexity of the climate system.},

	abstract = {Proposals to geoengineer Earth’s climate by cirrus cloud thinning ({CCT}) potentially offer advantages over solar radiation management schemes: amplified cooling of the Arctic and smaller perturbations to global mean precipitation in particular. Using an idealized climate model implementation of {CCT} in which ice particle fall speeds were increased 2×, 4×, and 8× we examine the relationships between effective radiative forcing ({ERF}) at the top of atmosphere, near-surface temperature, and the response of the hydrological cycle. {ERF} was nonlinear with fall speed change and driven by the trade-off between opposing positive shortwave and negative longwave radiative forcings. {ERF} was-2.0Wm-2 for both 4× and 8× fall speeds. Global mean temperature decreased linearly with {ERF}, while Arctic temperature reductions were amplified compared with the global mean change. The change in global mean precipitation involved a rapid adjustment ({\textasciitilde} 1\%/Wm2), which was linear with the change in the net atmospheric energy balance, and a feedback response ({\textasciitilde}2\%/°C). Global mean precipitation and evaporation increased strongly in the first year of {CCT}. Intensification of the hydrological cycle was promoted by intensification of the vertical overturning circulation of the atmosphere, changes in boundary layer climate favorable for evaporation, and increased energy available at the surface for evaporation (from increased net shortwave radiation and reduced subsurface storage of heat). Such intensification of the hydrological cycle is a significant side effect to the cooling of climate by {CCT}. Any accompanying negative cirrus cloud feedback response would implicitly increase the costs and complexity of {CCT} deployment.},

Stratocumulus decks, which cover wide swaths of Earth's surface, are considered the primary target for this geoengineering approach. The macroscale properties of this cloud type exhibit a high sensitivity to cloud microphysics, exposing the potential for undesired changes in cloud optical properties in response to {MCB}. In this study, we apply a highly detailed Lagrangian cloud model, coupled to an idealized parcel model as well as a full three-dimensional large-eddy simulation model, to show that the choice of seeded particle size distribution is crucial to the success of {MCB}, and that its efficacy can be significantly reduced by undesirable microphysical processes. The presence of even a small number of large particles in the seeded size spectrum may trigger significant precipitation, which will reduce cloud water and may even break up the cloud deck, reducing the scene albedo and hence counteracting {MCB}. On the other hand, a seeded spectrum comprising a large number of small particles reduces the fraction of activated cloud droplets and increases entrainment and evaporation of cloud water, which also reduces the efficiency of {MCB}. In between, there may exist an aerosol size distribution that minimizes undesirable microphysical processes and enables optimal {MCB}. This optimal size distribution is expected to be case dependent.},

	abstract = {Persistent greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions threaten global climate goals and have prompted consideration of climate controls supplementary to emissions mitigation. We present {MARGO}, an idealized model of optimally-controlled climate change, which is complementary to both simpler conceptual models and more complicated Integrated Assessment Models. The four methods of controlling climate damage - mitigation, carbon dioxide removal ({CDR}), adaptation, and solar radiation modification ({SRM}) - are not interchangeable, as they enter at different stages of the causal chain that connects {GHG} emissions to climate damages. Early and aggressive mitigation is necessary to stabilize {GHG} concentrations below a tolerable level. While the most cost-beneficial and cost-effective pathways to reducing climate suffering include deployments of all four controls, the quantitative trade-offs between the different controls are sensitive to value-driven parameters and poorly-known future costs and damages. Static policy optimization assumes perfect foresight and obscures the active role decision-makers have in shaping a climate trajectory. We propose an explicit policy response process wherein climate control policies are re-adjusted over time in response to unanticipated outcomes. We illustrate this process in two 'storyline' scenarios: (a) near-term increases in mitigation and {CDR} are deficient, such that climate goals are expected to slip out of reach; (b) {SRM} is abruptly terminated after 40 years of successful deployment, causing an extremely rapid warming which is amplified by an excess of {GHGs} due to deterred mitigation. In both cases, an optimized policy response yields substantial benefits relative to continuing the original policy. The {MARGO} model is intentionally designed to be as simple, transparent, customizable, and accessible as possible, addressing concerns about previous climate-economic modelling approaches and enabling a more diverse set of stakeholders to engage with these essential and timely topics.},

	abstract = {We present a method to describe the relationship between particle dry diameter and cloud condensation nuclei ({CCN}) activity using a single hygroscopicity parameter κ. Values of the hygroscopicity parameter are between 0.5 and 1.4 for highly-{CCN}-active salts such as sodium chloride, between 0.01 and 0.5 for slightly to very hygroscopic organic species, and 0 for nonhygroscopic components. Observations indicate that atmospheric particulate matter is typically characterized by 0.1 {\textless}κ{\textless}0.9. If compositional data are available and if the hygroscopicity parameter of each component is known, a multicomponent hygroscopicity parameter can be computed by weighting component hygroscopicity parameters by their volume fractions in the mixture. In the absence of information on chemical composition, experimental data for complex, multicomponent particles can be fitted to obtain the hygroscopicity parameter. The hygroscopicity parameter can thus also be used to conveniently model the {CCN} activity of atmospheric particles, including those containing insoluble components. We confirm the applicability of the hygroscopicity parameter and its mixing rule by applying it to published hygroscopic diameter growth factor and {CCN}-activation data for single- and multi-component particles containing varying amounts of inorganic, organic and surface active compounds. We suggest that K may be fit to {CCN} data assuming σs/a=0.072 J m-2 and present a table of κ derived for this value and T=298.15K. The predicted hygroscopicities for mixtures that contain the surfactant fulvic acid agree within uncertainties with the measured values. It thus appears that this approach is adequate for predicting {CCN} activity of mixed particles containing surface active materials, but the generality of this assumption requires further verification.},

	abstract = {Surface tension influences the fraction of atmospheric particles that become cloud droplets. Although surfactants are an important component of aerosol mass, the surface tension of activating aerosol particles is still unresolved, with most climate models assuming activating particles have a surface tension equal to that of water. By studying picoliter droplet coalescence, we demonstrate that surfactants can significantly reduce the surface tension of finite-sized droplets below the value for water, consistent with recent field measurements. Significantly, this surface tension reduction is droplet size-dependent and does not correspond exactly to the macroscopic solution value. A fully independent monolayer partitioning model confirms the observed finite-size-dependent surface tension arises from the high surface-to-volume ratio in finite-sized droplets and enables predictions of aerosol hygroscopic growth. This model, constrained by the laboratory measurements, is consistent with a reduction in critical supersaturation for activation, potentially substantially increasing cloud droplet number concentration and modifying radiative cooling relative to current estimates assuming a water surface tension. The results highlight the need for improved constraints on the identities, properties, and concentrations of atmospheric aerosol surfactants in multiple environments and are broadly applicable to any discipline where finite volume effects are operative, such as studies of the competition between reaction rates within the bulk and at the surface of confined volumes and explorations of the influence of surfactants on dried particle morphology from spray driers.},

	abstract = {Although carbon dioxide emissions are by far the most important mediator of anthropogenic climate disruption, a number of shorter-lived substances with atmospheric lifetimes of under a few decades also contribute significantly to the radiative forcing that drives climate change. In recent years, the argument that early and aggressive mitigation of the emission of these substances or their precursors forms an essential part of any climate protection strategy has gained a considerable following. There is often an implication that such control can in some way make up for the current inaction on carbon dioxide emissions. The prime targets for mitigation, known collectively as short-lived climate pollution ({SLCP}), are methane, hydrofluo-rocarbons, black carbon, and ozone. A re-examination of the issues shows that the benefits of early {SLCP} mitigation have been greatly exaggerated, largely because of inadequacies in the methodologies used to compare the climate effects of short-lived substances with those of {CO}2, which causes nearly irreversible climate change persisting millennia after emissions cease. Eventual mitigation of {SLCP} can make a useful contribution to climate protection, but there is little to be gained by implementing {SLCP} mitigation before stringent carbon dioxide controls are in place and have caused annual emissions to approach zero. Any earlier implementation of {SLCP} mitigation that substitutes to any significant extent for carbon dioxide mitigation will lead to a climate irreversibly warmer than will a strategy with delayed {SLCP} mitigation. {SLCP} mitigation does not buy time for implementation of stringent controls on {CO}2 emissions. © 2014 by Annual Reviews.

A variation on superparameterization ({SP}) called “ultraparameterization” ({UP}) is developed, in which the grid spacing of the cloud-resolving models ({CRMs}) is fine enough (250 × 20 m) to explicitly capture the {BL} turbulence, associated clouds, and entrainment in a global climate model capable of multiyear simulations. {UP} is implemented within the Community Atmosphere Model using 2° resolution (∼14,000 embedded {CRMs}) with one-moment microphysics. By using a small domain and mean-state acceleration, {UP} is computationally feasible today and promising for exascale computers. Short-duration global {UP} hindcasts are compared with {SP} and satellite observations of top-of-atmosphere radiation and cloud vertical structure. The most encouraging improvement is a deeper {BL} and more realistic vertical structure of subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) clouds, due to stronger vertical eddy motions that promote entrainment. Results from 90 day integrations show climatological errors that are competitive with {SP}, with a significant improvement in the diurnal cycle of offshore Sc liquid water. Ongoing concerns with the current {UP} implementation include a dim bias for near-coastal Sc that also occurs less prominently in {SP} and a bright bias over tropical continental deep convection zones. Nevertheless, {UP} makes global eddy-permitting simulation a feasible and interesting alternative to conventionally parameterized {GCMs} or {SP}-{GCMs} with turbulence parameterizations for studying {BL} cloud-climate and cloud-aerosol feedback.},

Our setup allows for selective superparameterization, that is, for applying superparameterization in local regions selected by the user, while keeping the standard parameterization of the global model intact outside this region. Computationally, this setup can result in major geographic load imbalance, because of the large difference in computational load between superparameterized and nonsuperparameterized model columns.

A recently proposed climate engineering mechanism ({CEM}) intends to reduce high cloud cover by seeding cirrus clouds with efficient ice nuclei ({IN}) and therefore cool climate. Here, the susceptibility of cirrus clouds to the injection of ice nuclei in the upper troposphere is investigated in the extended Community Atmospheric Model version 5 ({CAM}5). Due to large uncertainties associated with the dominant ice nucleation mechanism in cirrus clouds, different control cases were simulated. In addition to pure homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, cases with competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation and different fractions of mineral dust active as {IN} were considered. Whereas seeding in the pure heterogeneous case leads to a strong warming due to overseeding, an optimal seeding {IN} concentration of approximately 18 l−1 was found for the other cases. For the optimal seeding concentration, a reduction in the net cloud forcing ({NCF}) of up to 2 W m−2 was simulated, corresponding to a strong cooling effect. To optimize the cooling and minimize the amount of seeding material, globally nonuniform seeding strategies were tested, with minimal seeding in the summer hemisphere and in the tropics. With seeding applied to less than half the globe, an even stronger reduction in the {NCF} was achieved. This suggests that the {CEM} could work for an atmosphere even with considerable heterogeneous ice nucleation and that the desired cooling could be obtained without seeding the entire globe.},

Using the {FV}3GFS model at coarse resolution, we propose a method of machine learning corrective tendencies from a hindcast simulation nudged toward observational analysis. We show that a random forest can predict the nudging tendencies from this hindcast simulation with moderate skill using only the model state as input. This random forest is then coupled to {FV}3GFS, adding corrective tendencies of temperature, specific humidity and horizontal winds at each timestep. The coupled model shows no signs of instability in year-long simulations and has significant reductions in short-term forecast error for 500 {hPa} height, surface pressure and near-surface temperature. Furthermore, the root mean square error of the annual-mean precipitation is reduced by about 20\%. Biases of other variables remain similar or in some cases, like upper-atmospheric temperature, increase in the year-long simulations.},

They promise to be reference models that could be used to improve computationally affordable coarse-grid global climate models across a range of climates, reducing uncertainties in regional precipitation and temperature trends. Here, machine learning of nudging tendencies as functions of column state is used to correct the physical parameterization tendencies of temperature, humidity, and optionally winds, in a real-geography coarse-grid model ({FV}3GFS with a 200 km grid) to be closer to those of a 40-day reference simulation using X-{SHiELD}, a modified version of {FV}3GFS with a 3 km grid. Both simulations specify the same historical sea-surface temperature fields. This methodology builds on a prior study using a global observational analysis as the reference. The coarse-grid model without machine learning corrections has too few clouds, causing too much daytime heating of land surfaces that creates excessive surface latent heat flux and rainfall. This bias is avoided by learning downwelling radiative flux from the fine-grid model. The best configuration uses learned nudging tendencies for temperature and humidity but not winds. Neural nets slightly outperform random forests. Forecasts of 850 {hPa} temperature gain 18 hr of skill at 3–7 days leads and time-mean precipitation patterns are improved 30\% by applying the {ML} correction. Adding machine-learned wind tendencies improves 500 {hPa} height skill for the first five days of forecasts but degrades time-mean upper tropospheric temperature and zonal wind patterns thereafter.},

	abstract = {Considering the ambitious climate targets of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2°C, with aspirations of even 1.5°C, questions arise on how to achieve this. Climate geoengineering has been proposed as a potential tool to minimize global harm from anthropogenic climate change. Here, an Earth system model is used to evaluate the climate response when transferring from a high {CO}2 forcing scenario, {RCP}8.5, to a middle-of-the-road forcing scenario, like {RCP}4.5, using aerosol geoengineering. Three different techniques are considered: stratospheric aerosol injections ({SAI}), marine sky brightening ({MSB}), and cirrus cloud thinning ({CCT}). The climate states appearing in the climate geoengineering cases are found to be closer to {RCP}4.5 than {RCP}8.5 and many anthropogenic global warming symptoms are alleviated. All three techniques result in comparable global mean temperature evolutions. However, there are some notable differences in other climate variables due to the nature of the forcings applied. {CCT} acts mainly on the longwave part of the radiation budget, as opposed to {MSB} and {SAI} acting in the shortwave. This yields a difference in the response, particularly in the hydrological cycle. The responses in sea ice, sea level, ocean heat, and circulation, as well as the carbon cycle, are furthermore compared. Sudden termination of the aerosol injection geoengineering shows that the climate very rapidly (within two decades) reverts to the path of {RCP}8.5, questioning the sustainable nature of such climate geoengineering, and simultaneous mitigation during any such form of climate geoengineering would be needed to limit termination risks.},

	abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions ({ACIs}) are considered to be the most uncertain driver of present-day ra-diative forcing due to human activities. The nonlinearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well-defined sources provide "opportunis-tic experiments" (also known as natural experiments) to investigate {ACI} in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatiotemporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors. We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite datasets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radia-tive forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of {ACI}, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change.},

While the direct effect was found to be significant, the indirect effects on clouds were much more effective in reducing global mean temperature as well as having less of an impact on global mean precipitation per unit temperature reduction.

However, the benefits or costs of geoengineering for human health are largely unknown. We project how geoengineering could impact malaria risk by comparing current transmission suitability and populations-at-risk under moderate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5) with and without geoengineering. We show that if geoengineering deployment cools the tropics, it could help protect high elevation populations in eastern Africa from malaria encroachment, but could increase transmission in lowland sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Compared to extreme warming, we find that by 2070, geoengineering would nullify a projected reduction of nearly one billion people at risk of malaria. Our results indicate that geoengineering strategies designed to offset warming are not guaranteed to unilaterally improve health outcomes, and could produce regional trade-offs among Global South countries that are often excluded from geoengineering conversations. Solar geoengineering, an emergency climate intervention, could shift one billion people back into areas of malaria risk. Regional tradeoffs and potential adverse outcomes point to the need for health sector planning with Global South leadership.},

Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention - deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as {CO}2 from the atmosphere. When focused on {CO}2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal ({CDR}). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2gC, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5gC warming by the year 2100, require some form of {CDR}. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric {CO}2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed {CDR}. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or {CDRMIP}) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of {CDR}. Here, we describe the first set of {CDRMIP} experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning {CDR}-induced climate reversibility, the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric {CO}2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the {CDR} potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.},

The electrons reside in large cavities or channels or both in the host lattice. We report here the first synthesis of thermally stable inorganic electrides with cation-to-electron ratios of 1:1 as in organic electrides. Although alkali metal adducts to alumino-silicate zeolites are well known, the cation-to-electron ratio is generally 3:1 or greater because these zeolites contain alkali cations prior to incorporation of the alkali metal. In this work, two pure silica zeolites, {ITQ}-4and {ITQ}-7, with pore diameters of approximately 7 A, absorb up to 40 wt \% cesium from the vapor phase (even at room temperature). The other alkali metals (except Li) can also be introduced at elevated temperatures. The optical and magnetic properties of the cesium-loaded samples suggest ionization to form Cs+ and e- with substantial electron-spin pairing. The metal-loaded samples are stable to at least 100 degrees C and are able to reduce small aromatic molecules such as benzene and naphthalene to the radical anions within the pores of the zeolite.},

Recent toxicological studies suggest that wildfire particulate matter may be more toxic than equal doses of ambient {PM}2.5. Air quality regulations however assume that the toxicity of {PM}2.5 does not vary across different sources of emission. Assessing whether {PM}2.5 from wildfires is more or less harmful than {PM}2.5 from other sources is a pressing public health concern. Here, we isolate the wildfire-specific {PM}2.5 using a series of statistical approaches and exposure definitions. We found increases in respiratory hospitalizations ranging from 1.3 to up to 10\% with a 10 μg m−3 increase in wildfire-specific {PM}2.5, compared to 0.67 to 1.3\% associated with non-wildfire {PM}2.5. Our conclusions point to the need for air quality policies to consider the variability in {PM}2.5 impacts on human health according to the sources of emission. Recent toxicological studies suggest that wildfire particulate matter may be more toxic than equal doses of ambient {PM}2.5. Here, the authors show that even for similar exposure levels, {PM}2.5 from wildfires is considerably more dangerous for respiratory health at the population level.},

Increased aerosol can enhance solar reflection from clouds countering greenhouse gas warming. Recently, this indirect effect has been extended from water droplet clouds to other types including mixed-phase clouds. Aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds are important because of their fundamental role on sea ice loss and polar climate change, but very little is known about aerosol effects on these clouds. Here we provide the first analysis of the effects of aerosol emitted from ship stacks into mixed-phase clouds. Satellite observations of solar reflection in numerous ship tracks reveal that cloud albedo increases 5 times more in liquid clouds when polluted and persist 2 h longer than in mixed-phase clouds. These results suggest that seeding mixed-phase clouds via shipping aerosol is unlikely to provide any significant counterbalancing solar radiative cooling effects in warming polar regions.

	abstract = {A simple heuristic model is described to assess the potential for increasing solar reflection by augmenting the aerosol population below marine low clouds, which nominally leads to increased cloud droplet concentration and albedo. The model estimates the collective impact of many point source particle sprayers, each of which generates a plume of injected particles that affects clouds over a limited area. A look-up table derived from simulations of an explicit aerosol activation scheme is used to derive cloud droplet concentration as a function of the sub-cloud aerosol size distribution and updraft speed, and a modified version of Twomey's formulation is used to estimate radiative forcing. Plume overlap is accounted for using a Poisson distribution , assuming idealized elongated cuboid plumes that have a length driven by aerosol lifetime and wind speed, a width consistent with satellite observations of ship track broadening , and a depth equal to an assumed boundary layer depth. The model is found to perform favorably against estimates of brightening from large eddy simulation studies that explicitly model cloud responses to aerosol injections over a range of conditions. Although the heuristic model does not account for cloud condensate or coverage adjustments to aerosol, in most realistic ambient remote marine conditions these tend to augment the Twomey effect in the large eddy simulations, with the result being a modest underprediction of brightening in the heuristic model. The heuristic model is used to evaluate the potential for global radiative forcing from marine cloud brightening as a function of the quantity, size, and lifetime of salt particles injected per sprayer and the number of sprayers deployed. Radiative forcing is sensitive to both the background aerosol size distribution in the marine boundary layer into which particles are injected and the assumed updraft speed. Given representative values from the literature, radiative forcing sufficient to offset a doubling of carbon dioxide F 2×{CO} 2 is possible but would require spraying 50 \% or more of the ocean area. This is likely to require at least 10 4 sprayers to avoid major losses of particles due to near-sprayer coagulation. The optimal dry diameter of injected particles, for a given salt mass injection rate, is 30-60 nm. A major consequence is that the total salt emission rate (50-70 Tg yr −1) required to offset F 2×{CO} 2 is a factor of five lower than the emissions rates required to generate significant forcing in previous studies with climate models, which have mostly assumed dry diameters for injected particles in excess of 200 nm. With the lower required emissions, the salt mass loading in the marine boundary layer for F 2×{CO} 2 is dominated by natural salt aerosol, with injected particles only contributing ∼ 10 \%. When using particle sizes optimized for cloud brightening, the aerosol direct radiative forcing is shown to make a minimal contribution to the overall radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Quantification of the radiative adjustment of marine low clouds to aerosol perturbations, regionally and globally, remains the largest source of uncertainty in assessing current and future climate. One of the important steps towards quantifying the role of aerosol in modifying cloud radiative properties is to quantify the susceptibility of cloud albedo and liquid water path ({LWP}) to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentration (N d). We use 10 years of spaceborne observations from the polar-orbiting Aqua satellite to quantify the albedo susceptibility of marine low clouds to N d perturbations over the northeast ({NE}) Pacific stratocumulus (Sc) region. Mutual information analysis reveals a dominating control of cloud state (e.g., {LWP} and N d) on low-cloud albedo susceptibility, relative to the meteorological states that drive these cloud states. Through a {LWP}-N d space decomposition of albedo susceptibilities, we show clear separation among susceptibility regimes (brightening or darkening), consistent with previously established mechanisms through which aerosol modulates cloud properties. These regimes include (i) thin non-precipitating clouds ({LWP} {\textless} 55 g m −2) that exhibit brightening (occur-ring 37 \% of the time), corresponding to the Twomey effect; (ii) thicker non-precipitating clouds, corresponding to entrainment-driven negative {LWP} adjustments that manifest as a darkening regime (36 \% of the time); and (iii) another brightening regime (22 \% of the time) consisting of mostly precipitating clouds, corresponding to precipitation-suppression {LWP} positive adjustments. Overall, we find an annual-mean regional low-cloud brightening potential of 20.8±2.68 W m −2 ln(N d) −1 , despite an overall negative {LWP} adjustment for non-precipitating marine stratocumulus, owing to the high occurrence of the Twomey-brightening regime. Over the {NE} Pacific, clear seasonal covariabilities among meteorological factors related to the large-scale circulation are found to play an important role in grouping conditions favorable for each susceptibility regime. When considering the covary-ing meteorological conditions, our results indicate that for the northeastern Pacific stratocumulus, clouds that exhibit the strongest brightening potential occur most frequently within shallow marine boundary layers over a cool ocean surface with a stable atmosphere and a dry free troposphere above. Clouds that exhibit a darkening potential associated with negative {LWP} adjustments occur most frequently within deep marine boundary layers in which the atmospheric instability and the ocean surface are not strong and warm enough to produce frequent precipitation. Cloud brightening associated with warm-rain suppression is found to preferably occur either under unstable atmospheric conditions or humid free-tropospheric conditions that co-occur with a warm ocean surface.},

The key findings are that {SST} has a dominant control on S0 in the presence of co-varying synoptic conditions and aerosol perturbations. Regions conducive to aerosol-induced darkening (brightening) clouds occur with high (low) local {SST}. Higher {SST} significantly hastens cloud-top evaporation with increasing aerosol loading, by accelerating entrainment and facilitating entrainment drying. In a global-warming-like scenario where aerosol loading is reduced, less cloud darkening is expected, mainly as a result of reduced entrainment drying.

	abstract = {Marine cloud brightening through sea spray injection has been proposed as a method of temporarily alleviating some of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, as part of a set of technologies called geoengineering. We outline here a proposal for three coordinated climate modeling experiments to test aspects of sea spray geoengineering, to be conducted under the auspices of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project ({GeoMIP}). The first, highly idealized, experiment (G1ocean-albedo) involves a uniform increase in ocean albedo to offset an instantaneous quadrupling of {CO}2 concentrations from preindustrial levels. Results from a single climate model show an increased land-sea temperature contrast, Arctic warming, and large shifts in annual mean precipitation patterns. The second experiment (G4cdnc) involves increasing cloud droplet number concentration in all low-level marine clouds to offset some of the radiative forcing of an {RCP}4.5 scenario. This experiment will test the robustness of models in simulating geographically heterogeneous radiative flux changes and their effects on climate. The third experiment (G4sea-salt) involves injection of sea spray aerosols into the marine boundary layer between 30°S and 30°N to offset 2 W m-2 of the effective radiative forcing of an {RCP}4.5 scenario. A single model study shows that the induced effective radiative forcing is largely confined to the latitudes in which injection occurs. In this single model simulation, the forcing due to aerosol-radiation interactions is stronger than the forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions.

We apply this energetic perspective to output from 11 fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models simulating experiment G1 of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project ({GeoMIP}), which achieves top-of-atmosphere energy balance between an abrupt quadrupling of {CO}2 from preindustrial levels (abrupt4xCO2) and uniform solar irradiance reduction. We divide the climate system response into a rapid adjustment, in which climate response is due to adjustment of the atmosphere and land surface on short time scales, and a feedback response, in which the climate response is predominantly due to feedback related to global mean temperature changes. Global mean temperature change is small in G1, so the feedback response is also small. G1 shows a smaller magnitude of land sensible heat flux rapid adjustment than in abrupt4xCO2 and a larger magnitude of latent heat flux adjustment, indicating a greater reduction of evaporation and less land temperature increase than abrupt4xCO2. The sum of surface flux changes in G1 is small, indicating little ocean heat uptake. Using an energetic perspective to assess precipitation changes, abrupt4xCO2 shows decreased mean evaporative moisture flux and increased moisture convergence, particularly over land. However, most changes in precipitation in G1 are in mean evaporative flux, suggesting that changes in mean circulation are small.

Using the Norwegian Earth System Model, the sensitivity of {MCB} to sea salt amount and particle size was studied by running a set of simulations in which Aitken (re = 0.04 μm), accumulation (re = 0.22 μm), or coarse (re = 2.46 μm) mode sea salt emissions were increased uniformly by 10-11 to 10-8 kg m-2 s -1. As desired, accumulation mode particles had a negative radiative effect of down to -3.3W m-2. Conversely, for Aitken mode particles, injections of 10-10 kg m-2 s-1 or greater led to a positive forcing of up to 8.4W m-2, caused by a strong competition effect combined with the high critical supersaturation of Aitken mode sea salt. The coarse mode particles gave a positive forcing of up to 1.2W m-2 because of a decrease in activation of background aerosols. Sensitivity experiments show that the competition effect dominated our results. {MCB} may have a cooling effect, but if the wrong size or injection amount is used, our simulations show a warming effect on the climate system. © 2013.

The efficacy of this as a strategy for global cooling rests on the extent to which aerosol-perturbed marine clouds will respond with increased albedo. Ship tracks, quasi-linear cloud features prevalent in oceanic regions impacted by ship exhaust, are a well-known manifestation of the effect of aerosol injection on marine clouds. We present here an analysis of the albedo responses in ship tracks, based on in situ aircraft measurements and three years of satellite observations of 589 individual ship tracks. It is found that the sign (increase or decrease) and magnitude of the albedo response in ship tracks depends on the mesoscale cloud structure, the free tropospheric humidity, and cloud top height. In a closed cell structure (cloud cells ringed by a perimeter of clear air), nearly 30\% of ship tracks exhibited a decreased albedo.

	abstract = {The rising costs of climate change merit serious evaluation of potential climate restoration solutions. The highest rate of change in climate is observed in the Arctic where the summer ice is diminishing at an accelerated rate. The loss of Arctic sea ice increases radiative forcing and contributes to global warming. Restoring reflectivity of Arctic ice could be a powerful lever to help in the effort to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Polar ice restoration should be considered in planning of 1.5°C pathways. In this paper, a novel localized surface albedo modification technique is presented that shows promise as a method to increase multiyear ice using reflective floating materials, chosen so as to have low subsidiary environmental impact. Detailed climate modeling studying the climate impact of such a method reveals more than 1.5°C cooler temperatures over a large part of the Arctic when simulating global sea ice albedo modification. In a region north of Barents and Kara Seas temperatures have been reduced by 3°C and in North Canada by almost 1°C. Additionally, there are notable increases in sea ice thickness (20–50 cm Arctic wide) and ice concentration ({\textgreater}15–20\% across large parts of central Arctic). These results suggest that the geoengineering technology proposed in this study may be a viable instrument for restoring Arctic ice.},

	abstract = {Earth system models ({ESMs}) are the primary tool used to understand and project changes to the climate system. {ESM} projections underpin analyses of human dimensions of the climate issue, yet little is known about how {ESMs} are used in human dimensions research. Such foundational information is necessary for future critical assessments of {ESMs}. We review applications of a leading {ESM}, the National Center for Atmospheric Research ({NCAR}) Community Earth System Model ({CESM}), to human dimensions topics since 2004. We find that this research has grown substantially over this period, twice as fast as {CESM} research overall. Although many studies have primarily addressed long-term impacts on physical systems with societal relevance, applications to managed, societal, and ecological systems have grown quickly and now make up more than half of {CESM} human dimensions work. {CESM} applications focused nearly equally on global and regional analyses, most often using multimodel ensembles, although the use of single simulations remains prevalent. Downscaling and bias correction of output was infrequent and most common for regional studies. U.S.-based, university-affiliated authors primarily drove human dimensions work using {CESM}, with only 12\% of authors based at {NCAR}. Our findings identify important questions that warrant further investigation, such as reasons for the infrequent use of downscaling and bias correction techniques; motivations to continue to use older model versions after newer model versions have been released; and model development needs for improved human dimensions applications. Additionally, our synthesis provides a baseline and framework that enables continued tracking of {CESM} and other {ESMs}.

The Southwest (+10.5\%) has the greatest increase in flashiness among historical flash flood hot spots, and the central {US} (+8.6\%) is emerging as a new flash flood hot spot. Additionally, future flash flood-prone frontiers are advancing northwards. This study calls on implementing climate-resilient mitigation measures for emerging flash flood hot spots.},

However, despite growing interest in {CDR} and {SRM}, scenarios focused on these potential responses to climate change tend to exclude feedbacks between social and climate systems (a criticism applicable to climate change scenarios more generally). We adapted the Manoa Mash-Up method to generate scenarios for {CDR} and {SRM} that were more integrative, creative, and dynamic. The method was modified to identify important branching points in which different choices in how to respond to climate change (feedbacks between climate and social dynamics) lead to a plurality of climate futures. An interdisciplinary group of participants imagined distant futures in which {SRM} or {CDR} develop into a major social-environmental force. Groups received other "seeds" of change, such as Universal Basic Income or China's Belt and Road Initiative, and surprises, such as permafrost collapse that grew to influence the course of events to 2100. Groups developed narratives describing pathways to the future and identified bifurcation points to generate families of branching scenarios. Four climate-social dynamics were identified: motivation to mitigate, moral hazard, social unrest, and trust in institutions. These dynamics could orient toward better or worse outcomes with {SRM} and {CDR} deployment (and mitigation and adaptation responses more generally) but are typically excluded from existing climate change scenarios. The importance of these dynamics could be tested through the inclusion of social-environmental feedbacks into integrated assessment models ({IAM}) exploring climate futures. We offer a step-by-step guide to the modified Manoa Mash-up method to generate more integrative, creative, and dynamic scenarios; reflect on broader implications of using this method for generating more dynamic scenarios for climate change research and policy; and provide examples of using the scenarios in climate policy communication, including a choose-your-own adventure game called Survive the Century (https://survivethecentury.net/), which was played by over 15,000 people in the first 2 weeks of launching.},

	abstract = {The largest uncertainty in the historical radiative forcing of climate is caused by the interaction of aerosols with clouds. Historical forcing is not a directly measurable quantity, so reliable assessments depend on the development of global models of aerosols and clouds that are well constrained by observations. However, there has been no systematic assessment of how reduction in the uncertainty of global aerosol models will feed through to the uncertainty in the predicted forcing. We use a global model perturbed parameter ensemble to show that tight observational constraint of aerosol concentrations in the model has a relatively small effect on the aerosol-related uncertainty in the calculated forcing between preindustrial and present-day periods. One factor is the low sensitivity of present-day aerosol to natural emissions that determine the preindustrial aerosol state. However, the major cause of the weak constraint is that the full uncertainty space of the model generates a large number of model variants that are equally acceptable compared to present-day aerosol observations. The narrow range of aerosol concentrations in the observationally constrained model gives the impression of low aerosol model uncertainty. However, these multiple "equifinal" models predict a wide range of forcings. To make progress, we need to develop a much deeper understanding of model uncertainty and ways to use observations to constrain it. Equifinality in the aerosol model means that tuning of a small number of model processes to achieve model-observation agreement could give a misleading impression of model robustness.},

We show that if geoengineering deployment cools the tropics, it could help protect high elevation populations in eastern Africa from malaria encroachment, but could increase transmission in lowland sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Compared to extreme warming, we find that by 2070, geoengineering would nullify a projected reduction of nearly one billion people at risk of malaria. Our results indicate that geoengineering strategies designed to offset warming are not guaranteed to unilaterally improve health outcomes, and could produce regional trade-offs among Global South countries that are often excluded from geoengineering conversations.},

A decision support tool with one of two conditions—Scenario or Forecast—encouraged participants to explore a large set of diversified decision options. We found that participants in the two conditions explored the options similarly, but chose differently. Participants in the Scenario Condition chose the strategies that performed well over the full range of uncertainties (robust strategies) significantly more frequently than did those in the Forecast Condition. This difference seems largely to be because participants in the Scenario Condition paid increased attention to worst-case futures. The results offer lessons for designing decision support tools.},

With contested framings parties to a decision disagree not only on potential solutions, but on the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. The quantitative tools of risk and policy analysis, commonly designed to develop and compare choices within a single decision framing, are poorly designed to bring quantitative information into debates with contested framings. This study aims to build on recent advances in decision making under deep uncertainty ({DMDU}) to demonstrate methods and tools that may help resolve the tension between quantitative decision support and multiworldview approaches for addressing wicked problems. The study employs robust decision making ({RDM}), one common {DMDU} method, and a new version of the lake model, a simple and widely used model of a coupled human and natural system, to conduct a stylized analysis that reflects three different worldviews. The {RDM} analysis solves the decision challenge independently for each worldview and then compares each set of solutions from the vantage of the other worldviews. The resulting utopia-dystopia matrix informs problem reframing that seeks robust, adaptive strategies independently consistent with each worldview and thus provides a locus for agreement. The study describes how stakeholder engagements might use such analytic tools and their information products to provide overlapping but alternative entry points for groups with fundamentally different worldviews to engage with each other in deliberative processes appropriate for wicked problems.},

Ship tracks-the visible manifestation of the indirect of effect of ship emissions on clouds as quasi-linear features-have long provided an opportunity to quantify these effects. However, they have been arduous to catalog and typically studied only in particular regions for short periods of time. Using a machine-learning algorithm to automate their detection we catalog more than 1 million ship tracks to provide a global climatology. We use this to investigate the effect of stringent fuel regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization in 2020 on their global prevalence since then, while accounting for the disruption in global commerce caused by {COVID}-19. We find a marked, but clearly nonlinear, decline in ship tracks globally: An 80\% reduction in {SO}[Formula: see text] emissions causes only a 25\% reduction in the number of tracks detected.},

Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction2, but these changes are subject to large uncertainties3. Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions4. However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks5,6. Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest. Investigations of the effect of aerosol emissions from shipping on cloud properties when both visible and invisible ship tracks are considered implies a large negative radiative effect (and associated cooling) from liquid water path adjustments.},

	abstract = {A sophisticated reader ought to view with great skepticism the prospect of answering questions about the long-term future. The checkered history of predicting the future-from the famous declarations that humans would never fly to the Limits to Growth study to claims about the "New Economy"-has dissuaded policymakers from considering the effects of their decisions more than a few months or years ahead. However, today's choices will significantly influence the course of the twenty-first century. New analytic methods, enabled by modern computers, may transform our ability to reason systematically about the long term. This report reviews traditional methods of grappling with the morrow, from narratives to scenario analysis, which fail to address the multiplicity of plausible long-term futures. The authors demonstrate a quantitative approach to long-term policy analysis ({LTPA}). Robust decision methods enable decisionmakers to examine a vast range of plausible futures and design near-term, often adaptive, strategies to be robust across them. Reframing the question "What will the long-term future bring?" as "How can we choose actions today that will be consistent with our long-term interests?" these methods provide powerful analytic support to humans' innate capacity for "what-if-ing." Choosing the challenge of sustainable development as an example, the authors discuss how these methods may be applied to real-world {LTPA} and a wide range of other challenges of decisionmaking under conditions of deep uncertainty.},

Here, we build on these recommendations by proposing a roadmap approach for the planning, coordination, and delivery of research to support a robust scientific assessment of {SRM} to reduce near-term climate risks in a defined timeframe. This approach is designed to support the evaluation of {SRM} as a possible rapid, temporary, additive measure to reduce catastrophic impacts from anthropogenic climate change, not as a substitute for aggressive {GHG} mitigation. Assessing {SRM} is proposed to be undertaken in the context of climate hazard risks through 2050, weighing the impacts associated with likely climate change trajectories against scenarios of possible {SRM} implementations. Provided that research is undertaken openly and that scientific resources are made widely available, the transparency of the process and the evidence generated would contribute to the democratization of information, participation by diverse stakeholders, more informed decision-making, and better opportunities for all people to weigh {SRM} options against climate change risks.},

These projections, in turn, will rely on simulations with global climate models. As with climate-change projections, these simulations need to adequately span a range of possible futures, describing different choices, such as start date and temperature target, as well as risks, such as termination or interruptions. {SRM} modeling simulations to date typically consider only a single scenario, often with some unrealistic or arbitrarily chosen elements (such as starting deployment in 2020), and have often been chosen based on scientific rather than policy-relevant considerations (e.g., choosing quite substantial cooling specifically to achieve a bigger response).

To address this gap, we begin by outlining some general considerations on scenario design for {SRM}.

However, the use of computer simulation to study the effects of climate change on human conflict and cooperation is still relatively rare. In this article, we consider some of the challenges and opportunities that face interdisciplinary teams seeking to develop models that incorporate human, ecological, and natural systems. There is an urgency to this task because climate-abetted socio-economic and inter-cultural stress can trigger conflict at all scales, which exacerbates human suffering. We argue that the interdisciplinary community of scholars with expertise in multi-agent artificial intelligence simulation and artificial life modeling have a unique opportunity to collaborate and address these challenges by attempting to develop artificial societies capable of uncovering adaptive pathways that can minimize social conflict and maximize cooperation in the face of climate-abetted social and ecological change.},

Here, we review uncertainty across the steps needed to create socio-ecological scenarios, from narrative storylines to the representation of human and biological processes in models and the estimation of scenario and model parameters. We find that socio-ecological scenarios and models would benefit from moving away from “stylized” approaches that do not consider a wide range of direct drivers and their dependency on indirect drivers. Indeed, a greater focus on the social phenomena is fundamental in understanding the functioning of nature on a human-dominated planet. There is no panacea for dealing with uncertainty, but several approaches to evaluating uncertainty are still not routinely applied in scenario modeling, and this is becoming increasingly unacceptable. However, it is important to avoid uncertainties becoming an excuse for inaction in decision-making when facing environmental challenges.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways ({SSPs}). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the {SSPs} calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the {SSP} narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

	abstract = {The ‘Anthropocene’ concept provides a conceptual framework that encapsulates the current global situation in which society has an ever-greater dominating influence on Earth System functioning. Simulation models used to understand earth system dynamics provide early warning, scenario analysis and evaluation of environmental management and policies. This paper aims to assess the extent to which current models represent the Anthropocene and suggest ways forward. Current models do not fully reflect the typical characteristics of the Anthropocene, such as societal influences and interactions with natural processes, feedbacks and system dynamics, tele-connections, tipping points, thresholds and regime shifts. Based on an analysis of current model representations of Anthropocene dynamics, we identify ways to enhance the role of modeling tools to better help us understand Anthropocene dynamics and address sustainability issues arising from them. To explore sustainable futures (‘safe and operating spaces’), social processes and anthropogenic drivers of biophysical processes must be incorporated, to allow for a spectrum of potential impacts and responses at different societal levels. In this context, model development can play a major role in reconciling the different epistemologies of the disciplines that need to collaborate to capture changes in the functioning of socio-ecological systems. Feedbacks between system functioning and underlying endogenous drivers should be represented, rather than assuming the drivers to be exogenous to the modelled system or stationary in time and space. While global scale assessments are important, the global scale dynamics need to be connected to local realities and vice versa. The diversity of stakeholders and potential questions requires a diversification of models, avoiding the convergence towards single models that are able to answer a wide range of questions, but without sufficient specificity. The novel concept of the Anthropocene can help to develop innovative model representations and model architectures that are better suited to assist in designing sustainable solutions targeted at the users of the models and model results.},

	doi = {10.18174/sesmo.18127},
	abstract = {Solar geoengineering, also known as Solar Radiation Modification ({SRM}), has been proposed to alter Earth's radiative balance to reduce the effects of anthropogenic climate change. {SRM} has been identified as a research priority, as it has been shown to effectively reduce surface temperatures, while substantial uncertainties remain around side effects and impacts. Global modeling studies of {SRM} have often relied on idealized scenarios to understand the physical processes of interventions and their widespread impacts. These extreme or idealized scenarios are not directly policy-relevant and are often physically implausible (such as imposing global solar reduction to counter the warming of an instantaneous quadrupling of {CO}2). The climatic and ecological impacts of politically relevant and potentially plausible {SRM} approaches have rarely been modeled and assessed. Nevertheless, commentators and policymakers often falsely assume that idealized or extreme scenarios are proposed solutions to climate change. This paper proposes 18 scenarios that appear to be broadly plausible from political and Earth System perspectives and encompass futures that could be both warnings or perhaps desirable. We place these scenarios into four groups following broader strategic contexts: (1) Global Management; (2) Regional Emergencies; (3) Coordinated Regional Interventions; and (4) Reactive Global Interventions. For each scenario, relevant model experiments are proposed. Some may be performed with existing setups of global climate models, while others require further specification. Developing and performing these model experiments-and assessing likely resulting impacts on society and ecosystems-would be essential to inform public debate and policymakers on the real-world issues surrounding {SRM}.},

In this study, we used a coupled climate model ({MPI}-{ESM}) with a very idealized setup to investigate the efficacy and risks of {CE} at a local scale in space and time (regional radiation management, {RRM}) assuming that cloud modification is technically possible. {RM} is implemented in the climate model by the brightening of low-level clouds (solar radiation management, {SRM}) and thinning of cirrus (terrestrial radiation management, {TRM}). The region chosen is North America, and we simulated a period of 30 years. The implemented sustained {RM} resulted in a net local radiative forcing of −9.8 Wm−2 and a local cooling of −0.8 K. Surface temperature ({SAT}) extremes (90th and 10th percentiles) show negative anomalies in the target region. However, substantial climate impacts were also simulated outside the target area, with warming in the Arctic and pronounced precipitation change in the eastern Pacific. As a variant of {RRM}, a targeted intervention to suppress heat waves ({HW}) was investigated in further simulations by implementing intermittent cloud modification locally, prior to the simulated {HW} situations. In most cases, the intermittent {RRM} results in a successful reduction of temperatures locally, with substantially smaller impacts outside the target area compared to the sustained {RRM}.},

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of {CO}2, and not in transient climate change scenarios.

	abstract = {The factors governing the rate of change in the amount of atmospheric water vapor are analyzed in simulations of climate change. The global-mean amount of water vapor is estimated to increase at a differential rate of 7.3\% K − 1 with respect to global-mean surface air temperature in the multi-model mean. Larger rates of change result if the fractional change is evaluated over a finite change in temperature (e.g., 8.2\% K − 1 for a 3 K warming), and rates of change of zonal-mean column water vapor range from 6 to 12\% K − 1 depending on latitude. Clausius–Clapeyron scaling is directly evaluated using an invariant distribution of monthly-mean relative humidity, giving a rate of 7.4\% K − 1 for global-mean water vapor. There are deviations from Clausius–Clapeyron scaling of zonal-mean column water vapor in the tropics and mid-latitudes, but they largely cancel in the global mean. A purely thermodynamic scaling based on a saturated troposphere gives a higher global rate of 7.9\% K − 1. Surface specific humidity increases at a rate of 5.7\% K − 1, considerably lower than the rate for global-mean water vapor. Surface specific humidity closely follows Clausius–Clapeyron scaling over ocean. But there are widespread decreases in surface relative humidity over land (by more than 1\% K − 1 in many regions), and it is argued that decreases of this magnitude could result from the land/ocean contrast in surface warming.},

	abstract = {The Community Atmosphere Model ({CAM}6.1), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model ({CESM}; version 2.1), simulates the life cycle (emission, transport, and deposition) of mineral dust and its interactions with physio-chemical components to quantify the impacts of dust on climate and the Earth system. The accuracy of such quantifications relies on how well dust-related processes are represented in the model. Here we update the parameterizations for the dust module, including those on the dust emission scheme, the aerosol dry deposition scheme, the size distribution of transported dust, and the treatment of dust particle shape. Multiple simulations were undertaken to evaluate the model performance against diverse observations, and to understand how each update alters the modeled dust cycle and the simulated dust direct radiative effect. The model–observation comparisons suggest that substantially improved model representations of the dust cycle are achieved primarily through the new more physically-based dust emission scheme. In comparison, the other modifications induced small changes to the modeled dust cycle and model–observation comparisons, except the size distribution of dust in the coarse mode, which can be even more influential than that of replacing the dust emission scheme. We highlight which changes introduced here are important for which regions, shedding light on further dust model developments required for more accurately estimating interactions between dust and climate.},

Unfortunately, many technical, procedural, and institutional challenges hamper effective data integration—detracting from interdisciplinary socio-environmental research and broader public impact. This paper reports on the experiences and challenges of social and physical data integration, as experienced by diverse Early Career Researchers ({ECRs}), and offers strategies for coping with and addressing these challenges. Through a workshop convened by the National Center for Atmospheric Research ({NCAR}) Innovator Program, 33 participants from different disciplines, career stages, and institutions across the United States identified four thematic data integration challenges related to complexity and uncertainty, communication, scale, and institutional barriers. They further recommended individual, departmental, and institutional scale responses to cope with and address these integration challenges. These recommendations seek to inform faculty and department support for {ECRs}, who are often encouraged—and even expected—to engage in integrative, problem-focused, and solutions-oriented research.},

	abstract = {Marine cloud brightening is a solar geoengineering1–3 proposal to cool atmospheric temperatures and reduce some impacts of climate change. To-date, modeling studies of solar geoengineering have primarily focused on large-scale schemes with objectives of stabilizing or mediating changes in global mean temperature4–7. However, these global proposals pose substantial governance challenges8–10, making regional interventions tailored toward targeted climate outcomes potentially more attractive in the near-term. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of regional marine cloud brightening in the North Pacific designed to mitigate extreme heat in the Western United States. We find cloud brightening in a remote mid-latitude region cools our target region more than brightening in a proximate subtropical region, but both schemes reduce the relative risk of dangerous summer heat exposure under present-day conditions, by 39\% and 25\% respectively. However, the same cloud brightening interventions under mid-century warming produce significantly hotter rather than cooler summers, both in the Western U.S. and other areas of the world. We trace this loss of efficacy to a nonlinear response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to the combination of greenhouse gas driven warming and regional cloud brightening. Our result demonstrates a risk in assuming that regional interventions that are effective under certain conditions will remain effective as the climate continues to change.},
